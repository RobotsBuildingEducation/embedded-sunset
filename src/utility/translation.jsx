Data Structures and Algorithms is a subject that often intimidates students due to its complexity and its use in challenging interviews. While it is indeed challenging and requires practice, with proper guidance, the concepts can become more approachable.

## Programming Languages

- **Understanding Code Interpretation**:
- Computers interpret code by breaking it down into tokens and translating it into machine code.
- Example:
  \`\`\`javascript
  let musician = new Musician("Drake");
  
  let top_song = musician.getTopSong();
  \`\`\`
- Tokens in the code include keywords (let, new), identifiers (musician, top_song, Musician), operators (=), and literals ("Drake").

- **String Conversion**:
- Strings are broken down into arrays of characters.
  - "Drake" becomes \`['D', 'r', 'a', 'k', 'e']\`.
- Each character is mapped to numerical codes (e.g., ASCII or Unicode) and then to binary representations.

## Data Structures

- **Memory Management**:
- Computers reserve space in memory and create addresses to reference information.
- Understanding how data is stored and referenced is crucial for grasping complex data structures.

- **Linked Lists**:
- A foundational data structure that helps in understanding more complex structures like trees and graphs.
- Represents a sequence of nodes where each node points to the next.

## Trees and Algorithms

- **Traversing Trees**:
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
  - Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
  - Useful for scenarios where you need to explore all possible paths.

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
  - Explores all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level.
  - Ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

- **Example of DFS Counting Null Nodes**:
\`\`\`javascript
let countNull = (root) => {
  let count = 0;

  let depthFirstSearch = (currentRoot) => {
    if (currentRoot === null) {
      count++;
      return;
    }

    for (let nextLocation in currentRoot) {
      depthFirstSearch(currentRoot[nextLocation]);
    }
  };

  depthFirstSearch(root);
  return count;
};
\`\`\`

- **Understanding Traversal**:
- Visualizing how algorithms navigate through data structures helps in comprehending their functionality.
- Breaking down each step and counting operations can clarify complex processes.

## Linked Lists

- **Definition**:
- A linear data structure where each element (node) contains data and a reference (link) to the next node.

- **Building a Linked List**:
\`\`\`javascript
class ListItem {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.linkedTo = null;
  }

  setLinkedTo(listItem) {
    this.linkedTo = listItem;
  }

  getLinkedTo() {
    return this.linkedTo;
  }
}

let meta = new ListItem("meta");
let instagram = new ListItem("instagram");
let reels = new ListItem("reels");

// Linking nodes
instagram.setLinkedTo(reels);
meta.setLinkedTo(instagram);

class LinkedList {
  constructor(head) {
    this.head = head;
  }

  getLastItem() {
    let currentItem = this.head;
    while (currentItem.getLinkedTo()) {
      currentItem = currentItem.getLinkedTo();
    }
    return currentItem;
  }
}

let company = new LinkedList(meta);

// Outputs the last item in the list
console.log(company.getLastItem());

      <div>
        Think about how communities fund schools. People work, create income and
        have that incomed taxed in a number of ways to provide the budgets and
        funds for schools. This eventually creates walled gardens and
        inequities.
        <br />
        <br />
        Robots Building Education is a platform using protocols that introduces
        new ways to provide funds for education by connecting participants
        beyond neighborhood lines. When students learn, real economic value is
        created. We believe this should be represented by creating material and
        resilient outcomes for communities.
        <br />
        <br />
        You might notice that this app is a little different than others. Things
        seem to work faster with less rules. Robots Building Education uses open
        source protocols to allow for seamless decentralized, cross-platform and
        permissionless experiences.
        <br />
        <br />
        This means depositing Bitcoin and sending it is as easy as easy as
        scanning a QR code with a popular app like Cash App and answering a
        question. That's it! No more and no less is needed.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is a new way that the internet. It can be used and afford new
        experiences like the ability to publish progress across different apps,
        create scholarships with learning or even take your Bitcoin deposits to
        other places!
      </div>
      // <div>
      //   The point of AI is to save you time and energy. At the same time, real
      //   education is about challenging yourself so that you can create real
      //   knowledge. In short, you'll work through 100+ questions and it will
      //   introduce you to building your ideas with software, learning computer
      //   science and creating opportunities for yourself with good technology.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   I also want to teach you quickly, effectively and in a similar fashion

      //   software entrepeneur needs to learn about business, engineering,
      //   investing, marketing, sales, design and a number of other well-rounded
      //   skills in order to be successful, which is what we try to prepare you
      //   here with.

      //   <br />
      //   There are many things beyond coding taught on RO.B.E, ranging from the
      //   psychology of self-esteem, to the development of startups distributed
      //   globally. You are encouraged to imagine, think big and work hard in
      //   order to find success here.
      //   <br />
      //   <br /> The app is a service created by Robots Building Education, a
      //   platform founded on researching technology the following three
      //   priorities:
      //   <br /> <br />
      //   1. Every student should have access to many good teachers.
      //   <br />
      //   2. Online education should be the best education.
      //   <br />
      //   3. Learning creates scholarships.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   This is accomplished with the human-computer interaction discipline,
      //   which researches how to make technology more useful and meaningful. I
      //   personally revise anything done with AI to add human touch to it as to
      //   not offer cheap generated material but a genuine delivery of good
      //   quality education.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   The following are all the features and benefits you'll find across the
      //   platform which are typically free. As of now I just ask folks to
      //   optionally sign up for $10 to access more content around
      //   entrepreneurship, finance, and engineering to the work and to create a
      //   stronger network.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   Why so low for so much? I love education technology and I want to work
      //   on this platform until you feel it's worth supporting. I also believe
      //   that social media helps me reach so many people that keeping it low
      //   price is only fair. I would eventually like to explore teaching folks so
      //   we can create a pipeline to access more capital from folks eager to
      //   invest in diverse technology businesses.

        This platform will help you learn fast and effectively, but it is also
        designed to challenge you. Real education can be uncomfortable and you
        have to embrace failure, mistakes and the improvement process. This
        platform isn't designed to be like Tiktok or Duolingo, where the
        material is handed to you in a way to maximize engagement, it's meant
        for you to learn and grow using the power of AI. In short, doing things
        the gritty way is often more enjoyable and meaningful. If you come
        across something confusing or tough, work through it! You'll be grateful
        you did.
        <br />
        <br />
        This platform comes with a tutor called Rox that will provide
        introductory video lectures that are handcrafted and animated to arm you
        with knowledge before or after practicing the questions involved in each
        chapter. Each lecture starts by working backwards, so that you can get
        used to appreciating challenge-oriented learning.

## Superando Dudas y el Síndrome del Impostor

Sentirse intimidado o cuestionar tus habilidades es normal. Incluso el instructor experimenta el síndrome del impostor. Estos sentimientos indican que te estás desafiando y apuntando a estándares más altos. Enfócate y reconoce que, con la preparación adecuada, puedes superar estos desafíos.

## Respuestas Rápidas a Preguntas Frecuentes

Aquí están las respuestas rápidas a preguntas comunes:

- **¿Es difícil programar?** No.
- **¿Qué computadora necesito?** No hay un requisito específico.
- **¿Soy demasiado mayor?** No.
- **¿Qué tipo de trabajos puedo hacer?** Numerosas oportunidades en varios campos.
- **¿Vale la pena un bootcamp?** No.

Para más detalles, visita las preguntas frecuentes en [robotsbuildingeducation.com](https://robotsbuildingeducation.com).

## Enfoque de Aprendizaje

El proceso de aprendizaje consta de cuatro pasos clave:

1. **Imaginar e Ilustrar**: Visualiza conceptos para mejorar la comprensión.
2. **Establecer Conexiones y Relaciones**: Vincula nuevas ideas con conocimientos existentes.
3. **Observar Nueva Información**: Presta atención a nuevas ideas y datos.
4. **Practicar**: Aplica lo que has aprendido mediante actividades prácticas.

## Abrazando la Experiencia de Aprendizaje

El objetivo es ayudarte a experimentar la sensación de aprender, desbloqueando el potencial para aprender cualquier cosa que desees. La programación no es solo sobre código; es un medio para diseñar soluciones, comunicar ideas e interactuar con el mundo.

## La Versatilidad de la Ciencia de la Computación

La ciencia de la computación es la ciencia de resolver problemas y puede aplicarse a cualquier campo: tecnología climática, psicología, investigación del cáncer, arte, deportes y más. La tecnología juega un papel donde exista información.

## Aliento para Seguir Adelante

Tómate tiempo para internalizar estas lecciones. Permítete convertirte en la persona que abraza los desafíos y continúa avanzando. Con coraje y persistencia, transformarás lo desconocido en familiaridad y generarás un impacto significativo.

## Visión General

Esta conferencia introduce los fundamentos de la programación, enfocándose en:

- **Objetos**
- **Funciones**
- **Bucles**
- **Datos y Lógica**
- **Funciones de Red**

El enfoque es comenzar con conceptos más desafiantes y descender a lo básico, atendiendo a estudiantes de diversos antecedentes.

## Objetos

- **Definición**: Los objetos en código modelan el mundo digital utilizando información, datos y lógica.
- **Clases**: Definen cómo se crean los objetos, incluyendo su estado y funcionalidad.
- **Punto Clave**: Los objetos tienen una forma común de definir su estado y gestionarlo a través de funcionalidades.
- **Ejemplos**:
  - Creación de una clase \`Robot\` en JavaScript.
  - Uso de objetos para estructurar datos en aplicaciones como publicaciones en redes sociales o transacciones de criptomonedas.
- **Conclusión**: La programación se trata de organizar información, no de matemáticas.

## Funciones

- **Propósito**: Esenciales para organizar y manejar datos.
- **Tipos**:

## Introducción

Las Estructuras de Datos y Algoritmos es una materia que a menudo intimida a los estudiantes debido a su complejidad y su uso en entrevistas desafiantes. Aunque es ciertamente desafiante y requiere práctica, con la orientación adecuada, los conceptos pueden volverse más accesibles.

## Lenguajes de Programación

- **Entendiendo la Interpretación del Código**:
  - Las computadoras interpretan el código descomponiéndolo en tokens y traduciéndolo a código máquina.
  - Ejemplo:
    \`\`\`javascript
    let musician = new Musician("Drake");
    let top_song = musician.getTopSong();
    \`\`\`
  - Los tokens en el código incluyen palabras clave (\`let\`, \`new\`), identificadores (\`musician\`, \`top_song\`, \`Musician\`), operadores (\`=\`) y literales (\`"Drake"\`).

- **Conversión de Cadenas**:
  - Las cadenas se descomponen en arrays de caracteres.
    - \`"Drake"\` se convierte en \`['D', 'r', 'a', 'k', 'e']\`.
  - Cada carácter se mapea a códigos numéricos (por ejemplo, ASCII o Unicode) y luego a representaciones binarias.

## Estructuras de Datos

- **Gestión de Memoria**:
  - Las computadoras reservan espacio en memoria y crean direcciones para referenciar información.
  - Comprender cómo se almacenan y referencian los datos es crucial para captar estructuras de datos complejas.

- **Listas Enlazadas**:
  - Una estructura de datos fundamental que ayuda a entender estructuras más complejas como árboles y grafos.
  - Representa una secuencia de nodos donde cada nodo apunta al siguiente.

## Árboles y Algoritmos

- **Recorridos de Árboles**:
  - **Búsqueda en Profundidad (DFS)**:
    - Explora lo más profundo posible a lo largo de cada rama antes de retroceder.
    - Útil en escenarios donde necesitas explorar todos los caminos posibles.

  - **Búsqueda en Anchura (BFS)**:
    - Explora todos los vecinos de un nodo antes de pasar al siguiente nivel.
    - Ideal para encontrar el camino más corto en grafos no ponderados.

- **Ejemplo de DFS Contando Nodos Nulos**:
  \`\`\`javascript
  let contarNulos = (raiz) => {
    let contador = 0;

    let busquedaEnProfundidad = (nodoActual) => {
      if (nodoActual === null) {
        contador++;
        return;
      }

      for (let siguienteNodo in nodoActual) {
        busquedaEnProfundidad(nodoActual[siguienteNodo]);
      }
    };

    busquedaEnProfundidad(raiz);
    return contador;
  };
  \`\`\`

- **Entendiendo el Recorrido**:
  - Visualizar cómo los algoritmos navegan a través de las estructuras de datos ayuda a comprender su funcionalidad.
  - Desglosar cada paso y contar operaciones puede aclarar procesos complejos.

## Listas Enlazadas

- **Definición**:
  - Una estructura de datos lineal donde cada elemento (nodo) contiene datos y una referencia (enlace) al siguiente nodo.

- **Construyendo una Lista Enlazada**:
  \`\`\`javascript
  class Nodo {
    constructor(valor) {
      this.valor = valor;
      this.enlace = null;
    }

    setEnlace(nodo) {
      this.enlace = nodo;
    }

    getEnlace() {
      return this.enlace;
    }
  }

  let meta = new Nodo("meta");
  let instagram = new Nodo("instagram");
  let reels = new Nodo("reels");

  // Enlazando nodos
  instagram.setEnlace(reels);
  meta.setEnlace(instagram);

  class ListaEnlazada {
    constructor(cabeza) {
      this.cabeza = cabeza;
    }

    getUltimoNodo() {
      let nodoActual = this.cabeza;
      while (nodoActual.getEnlace()) {
        nodoActual = nodoActual.getEnlace();
      }
      return nodoActual;
    }
  }

  let empresa = new ListaEnlazada(meta);
  console.log(empresa.getUltimoNodo()); // Muestra el último nodo de la lista
  \`\`\`

- **Revirtiendo una Lista Enlazada**:
  \`\`\`javascript
  reverse(cabeza) {
    let nodoPrevio = null;
    let nodoActual = cabeza;

    while (nodoActual) {
      let siguienteNodo = nodoActual.getEnlace();
      nodoActual.setEnlace(nodoPrevio);
      nodoPrevio = nodoActual;
      nodoActual = siguienteNodo;
    }
    return nodoPrevio;
  }
  \`\`\`

## Práctica y Perseverancia

- **Importancia de la Repetición**:
  - Practicar repetidamente estos conceptos ayuda a hacerlos naturales.
  - Tomarse el tiempo para entender a fondo las estructuras fundamentales es crucial para abordar temas avanzados.

- **Enfoque de Aprendizaje**:
  - Desglosa problemas complejos en partes más pequeñas y manejables.
  - Utiliza técnicas de visualización y conteo para seguir los pasos de los algoritmos.

        Esta plataforma te ayudará a aprender rápida y eficazmente, pero también
        está diseñada para desafiarte. La verdadera educación puede ser
        incómoda, y debes aceptar el fracaso, los errores y el proceso de
        mejora. Esta plataforma no está diseñada para ser como Tiktok o
        Duolingo, donde el material se te entrega de una manera que maximiza la
        interacción, sino que está pensada para que aprendas y crezcas usando el
        poder de la IA. En resumen, hacer las cosas de manera rigurosa a menudo
        es más gratificante y significativo. Si te encuentras con algo confuso o
        difícil, ¡trabájalo! Estarás agradecido de haberlo hecho.
        <br />
        <br />
        Esta plataforma viene con una tutora llamada Rox que te proporcionará
        videoconferencias introductorias, hechas a mano y animadas, para
        equiparte con conocimientos antes o después de practicar las preguntas
        de cada capítulo. Cada conferencia comienza trabajando hacia atrás, para
        que te acostumbres a apreciar el aprendizaje orientado a los desafíos.

      <div>
        El propósito de la IA es ahorrarte tiempo y energía. Al mismo tiempo, la
        educación real consiste en desafiarte a ti mismo para que puedas crear
        conocimiento verdadero. En resumen, trabajarás a través de más de 100
        preguntas y te introducirán a la construcción de tus ideas con software,
        aprendiendo ciencias de la computación y creando oportunidades para ti
        mismo con buena tecnología.
        <br />
        <br />
        También quiero enseñarte de manera rápida, efectiva y similar a cómo
        tendrías que adquirir habilidades en el trabajo. Al final del día, un
        emprendedor de software necesita aprender sobre negocios, ingeniería,
        inversión, marketing, ventas, diseño y una serie de otras habilidades
        completas para tener éxito, que es lo que intentamos prepararte aquí.
        <br />
        <br />
        En RO.B.E. se enseñan muchas cosas más allá de la codificación, que van
        desde la psicología de la autoestima hasta el desarrollo de startups
        distribuidas globalmente. Se te anima a imaginar, pensar en grande y
        trabajar duro para encontrar el éxito aquí.
        <br />
        <br />
        El Programa AI App es un servicio creado por Robots Building Education,
        una plataforma fundada en la investigación de tecnología con las
        siguientes tres prioridades:
        <br />
        <br />
        1. Todo estudiante debería tener acceso a muchos buenos maestros.
        <br />
        2. La educación en línea debería ser la mejor educación.
        <br />
        3. Aprender crea becas.
        <br />
        <br />
        Esto se logra con la disciplina de la interacción humano-computadora,
        que investiga cómo hacer que la tecnología sea más útil y significativa.
        Yo personalmente reviso cualquier cosa hecha con IA para añadirle un
        toque humano, de modo que no ofrezca material generado de manera barata,
        sino una entrega genuina de educación de buena calidad.
        <br />
        <br />
        A continuación se encuentran todas las características y beneficios que
        encontrarás en la plataforma, que típicamente son gratuitos. Por ahora,
        solo pido a las personas que opcionalmente se inscriban por $10 para
        acceder a más contenido relacionado con el emprendimiento, finanzas e
        ingeniería, y para crear una red más fuerte.
        <br />
        <br />
        ¿Por qué tan bajo precio por tanto? Me encanta la tecnología educativa y
        quiero trabajar en esta plataforma hasta que sientas que vale la pena
        apoyarla. También creo que las redes sociales me ayudan a llegar a
        muchas personas, por lo que mantener el precio bajo es lo justo.
        Eventualmente me gustaría explorar la enseñanza para que podamos crear
        un canal de acceso a más capital de personas deseosas de invertir en
        negocios tecnológicos diversos.
