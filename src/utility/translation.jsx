      "If AI can program themselves, it's likely that all work as we know it will fundamentally change. But for now, it's going to change the supply and demand of things in a relevant way.",
    faq_1_item_2:
      "In my view, AI makes software engineering more realistic for more people. Before AI, it was clear that there was an unmanageable amount of work being generated in a way where a software engineer would create more work than they could complete. So I personally find it more enjoyable to write code with AI than without it and I believe that it makes more things like entrepreneurship more accessible. Things can actually get done now.",
    faq_1_item_3:
      "Thinking critically, AI is mostly concerned with making good decisions. So roles that depend more on decisions will be impacted. In my view, that's more executive roles, thus the sweetspot these days is being a junior or senior engineer so you could start to build lean businesses on your own. So that's what we try to do here - we arm you with new skills and hope that it influences your decisions or opportunities in a good way.",
    faq_2_question: "What kind of computer do I need?",
    faq_2_item_1:
      "When it comes to learning, I recommend paper and pencil. RO.B.E is not a software intensive program. It can be used on your mobile device or any laptop. I like it on mobile phones.",
    faq_2_item_2:
      "If you're wondering what kind of computer you need to code, I recommend a macbook pro. The next best answer is whatever you can afford. People usually overthink this and the truth is you don't need anything fancy. There's no wrong answer.",
    faq_2_item_3:
      "Macbook pros are good general solution. If you need something specialized and you're certain about your investment, then in a similar spirit, invest in the best computing power you can get.",
    faq_3_question: "Is coding hard? Do I need to be good at math?",
    faq_3_item_1: "This is a loaded question.",
    faq_3_item_2:
      "No. You don't have to be good at math. And programming isn't hard, it's challenging. Education IS overcoming the challenge. You should recognize that you can accomplish the things you want to accomplish.",
    faq_3_item_3:
      "Coding is about organizing information. So if you can write instructions, you can write code.",
    faq_3_item_4:
      "So maybe you ask that question because there's a part of you that wishes someone would tell you that it can be made easy. People can make it easier. It's going to be a challenge, but that's part of the fun too.",
    faq_4_question: "What programming language should I pick?",
    faq_4_item_1:
      "So if you've done any research already, you've probably come across Python and Javascript. They're very popular for a reason, but before explaining why, I strongly recommend to think about what kind of machines you want to work on and what kind of problems you want to solve.",
    faq_4_item_2:
      "The reason Javascript and Python are so widespread is because of the internet. They're mostly used to do a lot of the service work of the internet.",
    faq_4_item_3:
      "But what if you need an iOS app, an android one, a video game, or some kind of robot? Ultimately you'll find that when you learn one language, you kinda learn them all. There's a reason for that, but ultimately it's like worrying whether you should learn how to use a hammer or drill when building a home - you're likely going to use many languages eventually and it'll all feel pretty familiar. There's no wrong answer.",
    faq_5_question: "Is a bootcamp worth it?",
    faq_5_item_1:
      "As usual, the best answer is going to be 'it depends'. What you really pay a lot of money for is an employment network, and as you've seen in recent years, that kind of business can experience hard times.",
    faq_5_item_2:
      "I don't recommend going to a bootcamp as a shortcut into the industry. A bootcamp is no different than being self-taught or going to college. You will still need to learn relevant skills, find early-stage employment, create business-savvy projects and pass technical interviews.",
    faq_5_item_3:
      "How you approach each will be wildly different. A self-taught developer in San Francisco is different than a computer science student in Nebraska. A dropout from Stanford will have a different environment than someone at a community college. The key thing here is that your environment plays an important role in your opportunities.",
    faq_6_question: "What is coding and what can I do with it?",
    faq_6_item_1:
      "Coding is a way to organize information. So it exists everywhere. Think of it this way. Coding is written by software engineers to organize information. Software engineers study computer science. Computer science is the science of computation. Computation is problem solving. So coding expresses the science of solving problems.",
    faq_6_item_2:
      "That means you can do just about anything. You can code for media, medicine research, sports, robots, energy systems, financial systems or just about anything you can think of. It's certainly a preferred game for entrepreneurs, but many people also take the well-balanced life approach with it too. So sometimes people code because they want a more relaxed life too.",
    faq_7_question: "Am I too old to learn?",
    faq_7_item_1:
      "No. Simply put, your brain doesn't work that way. You may experience some 'rustyness' if you haven't done deep learning of a subject in some time, but that's not too different than a college student realizing that they need to learn how to learn. Maybe you already know how to learn or you understand what works for you. Now suddenly you have an advantage.",
    faq_7_item_2:

## Overview

This lecture introduces the fundamentals of coding, focusing on:

- **Objects**
- **Functions**
- **Loops**
- **Data and Logic**
- **Network Functions**

The approach is to start with more challenging concepts and work down to the basics, catering to learners from diverse backgrounds.

## Objects

- **Definition**: Objects in code model the digital world using information, data, and logic.
- **Classes**: Define how objects are created, including their state and functionality.
- **Key Point**: Objects have a common way to define their state and manage it through functionality.
- **Examples**:
  - Creating a \`Robot\` class in JavaScript.
  - Using objects to structure data in applications like social media posts or crypto transactions.
- **Takeaway**: Coding is about organizing information, not about math.

## Functions

- **Purpose**: Essential for organizing and handling data.
- **Types**:
  - **Synchronous Functions**: Execute tasks sequentially (like cooking in a pan).
  - **Asynchronous Functions**: Allow other processes to run concurrently (like cooking in an oven).
- **Importance**: Understanding functions helps manage data flow, especially when handling data across networks.

## Loops

- **Usage**: Perform repeatable actions on groups of data.
- **Types of Looping Functions**:
  - Transforming values.
  - Filtering values.
  - Reversing values.
- **Example**: Using \`forEach\` in JavaScript to find an artist with the highest Spotify monthly listeners.
- **Documentation**: Encouraged to read language documentation to understand built-in methods and functionalities.

## Data and Logic

- **Fundamentals**:
  - Data types include words, numbers, groups, and logical conclusions.
  - Logic boils down to true or false values—how computers interpret the world.
- **Examples**:
  - Defining objects like \`obama\` and \`elon\` with properties.
  - Creating functions that use logical conditions to return results.
- **Key Point**: Individual pieces of data create logic; groups of data create functionality.

## Coding and Logic (Reinforced)

- **Coding**: The organization of information.
- **Logic**: Determining if statements are true or false.
- **Real-World Connection**: Observing how everyday items and situations can be represented in code.
- **Encouragement**: Understand that coding concepts can be grasped without heavy emphasis on math.

## Practice and Learning Strategies

- **Use AI Assistance**: Utilize AI tools like ChatGPT for guidance.
- **Hands-On Practice**:
  - Write code by hand on paper.
  - Draw connections and visualize data structures.
- **Model Real-World Data**: Practice representing real-world scenarios as data models in code.
- **Mindset**: Focus on learning and understanding rather than worrying about right or wrong.

## Conclusion

- **Main Takeaways**:
  - Coding models the digital world with information, data, and logic.
  - Organizing information is the essence of coding.
  - Logic in coding is about true or false values.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Prepare to build visual applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
- **Encouragement**:
  - Slow down and internalize the lessons.
  - Embrace challenges and trust the learning process.
  - Practice consistently to strengthen your skills.

**UI/UX** stands for User Interfaces and User Experiences. It's a multidisciplinary approach based on the study of human-computer interaction, also known as **Interaction Design** or simply **Design**. This field goes beyond visual design and idea brainstorming; it's a thoughtful practice applicable in many environments.

## Role of an Interaction Designer

Interaction designers:

- Research and design based on human-computer interaction.
- Conduct surveys, interviews, and observations to gather deeper insights into a product.
- Focus on improving experiences, such as enhancing a restaurant's experience or determining which movie trailer generates the most anticipation.
- Combine technical skills and business acumen to amplify impact.

## Accessibility

- **Importance**: Accessibility focuses on enabling more people to use products and services.
- **Considerations**:
  - Designing for blind users who rely on screen readers.
  - Organizing information to make sense for both visual and auditory users.
- **Benefits**:
  - Thoughtful accessibility design often benefits all users.
  - Effective organization can make content more meaningful for people using only audio, such as in podcasts or radio.

## Multidisciplinarity

- Design is fundamentally multidisciplinary and can be applied in fields like chemical engineering, business, architecture, and education.
- **Impact of Choices**:
  - The words you choose can influence how search engines and social media algorithms distribute your material.
  - The intent behind features and the tone you use can affect user retention and success.
- **Attention to Detail**: Good design is about making the people you're designing for happy, which requires direct communication and research.

## Heuristics

- **Definition**: Heuristics are guidelines used when creating with constraints or limited feedback.
- **Application**:
  - Considering how a user can correct a mistake or malfunction.
  - Using concepts like **affordances**, which are signals or properties of an object that inform a user of its possible uses.
- **Examples**:
  - Recognizing that a water pitcher is meant for pouring water, not as a glove.
  - Understanding that pixels on a screen represent interactive buttons.

## Design Systems

- **Tools and Methods**:
  - Paper prototypes, surveys, personal interviews, online tools.
- **Considerations**:
  - Each tool has trade-offs that affect outcomes.
  - Resources and budgets can influence the effectiveness of methods.
  - Different settings (e.g., boardroom vs. TikTok) can yield different results.
- **Collaboration**:
  - Over time, you discover what works well with you and different teams.
  - It's important to think critically and keep an open mind when making design choices.

## Further Reading

- **"The Design of Everyday Things"** by Don Norman: A foundational book in the field of human-computer interaction.
- **NNGroup.com**: Resources from the Nielsen Norman Group for professionals concerned with usability standards.
- **Bitcoin.design**: An open-source platform supporting usability research and development for Bitcoin.

## Conclusion

Interaction design is a discipline that combines research, creativity, and empathy to improve user experiences. By integrating principles of accessibility, multidisciplinarity, and heuristics, designers can create meaningful and effective solutions. Members of the Robots Building Education community are encouraged to apply these principles to communicate ideas, improvements, or case studies to gain experience. Collaboration and brainstorming are welcomed to enhance our AI mentoring platform.

- **Components**: Functions that return UI elements and manage their own state and properties.
- **Main Parts of a React Component**:
  1. **Hooks**: Functions that handle and synchronize operations with the component's state (e.g., \`useState\`).
  2. **State**: Dynamic data within the component that changes over time, triggering re-renders.
  3. **Properties (Props)**: Data passed into the component that should remain unchanged within it.

- **Event-Based Programming**: React components respond to user interactions (events) that trigger state changes and UI updates.

## Data Flow in React

- React uses a **one-way data flow**, making it intuitive to design relationships and manage data.
- **Updating State**: Changing a component's state refreshes the display and re-renders the component.
- **Props vs. State**:
  - **Props**: Immutable data received from parent components.
  - **State**: Mutable data managed within the component.

## Practical Example: Tweet Component

- Demonstrated a \`Tweet\` component that displays tweet information and handles user interactions like likes.
- Showed how to:
  - Use hooks (\`useState\`) to manage state.
  - Pass functions and data as props to child components.
  - Update state in response to events (e.g., \`createLike\` function).

## Overcoming Challenges

- Recognized that combining hooks, state, and props can be complex.
- Encouraged practice, experimentation, and embracing challenges to understand React's data flow.
- Emphasized that professional software engineers also navigate these complexities.

## HTML and Structuring the Display

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: Used to structure content on the web.
- **Elements and Attributes**:
  - **Events**: Handle user interactions like clicks and hovers.
  - **ID**: Unique identifier for elements.
  - **Class**: Groups elements for styling.
  - **Style**: Inline styling of elements.

- Recommended thinking of HTML elements as containers organized logically.

## CSS and Styling Elements

- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Styles the appearance of HTML elements.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Box Model**: Shapes elements using properties like \`margin\`, \`padding\`, \`border\`, and \`width\`.
  - **Flexbox Model**: Positions elements in rows or columns for responsive design.
  - **Animation Model**: Animates elements using CSS animations or JavaScript.

- Suggested using inline styles or CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled-Components with React for better control.

## Combining Concepts

- Provided examples of combining React components with HTML and CSS to create interactive UI elements.
- Showed how to use state and event handlers to manage data and user interactions.
- Emphasized the importance of understanding how these technologies work together.

## Practice and Learning

- Encouraged using resources like W3Schools and documentation to explore HTML and CSS attributes.
- Recommended leveraging AI tools like ChatGPT for assistance.
- Highlighted the value of hands-on experimentation and breaking down complex problems.

## Conclusion

- Reinforced that mastering frontend development involves understanding components, data flow, and styling.

Data Structures and Algorithms is a subject that often intimidates students due to its complexity and its use in challenging interviews. While it is indeed challenging and requires practice, with proper guidance, the concepts can become more approachable.

## Programming Languages

- **Understanding Code Interpretation**:
- Computers interpret code by breaking it down into tokens and translating it into machine code.
- Example:
  \`\`\`javascript
  let musician = new Musician("Drake");
  
  let top_song = musician.getTopSong();
  \`\`\`
- Tokens in the code include keywords (let, new), identifiers (musician, top_song, Musician), operators (=), and literals ("Drake").

- **String Conversion**:
- Strings are broken down into arrays of characters.
  - "Drake" becomes \`['D', 'r', 'a', 'k', 'e']\`.
- Each character is mapped to numerical codes (e.g., ASCII or Unicode) and then to binary representations.

## Data Structures

- **Memory Management**:
- Computers reserve space in memory and create addresses to reference information.
- Understanding how data is stored and referenced is crucial for grasping complex data structures.

- **Linked Lists**:
- A foundational data structure that helps in understanding more complex structures like trees and graphs.
- Represents a sequence of nodes where each node points to the next.

## Trees and Algorithms

- **Traversing Trees**:
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
  - Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
  - Useful for scenarios where you need to explore all possible paths.

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
  - Explores all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level.
  - Ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

- **Example of DFS Counting Null Nodes**:
\`\`\`javascript
let countNull = (root) => {
  let count = 0;

  let depthFirstSearch = (currentRoot) => {
    if (currentRoot === null) {
      count++;
      return;
    }

    for (let nextLocation in currentRoot) {
      depthFirstSearch(currentRoot[nextLocation]);
    }
  };

  depthFirstSearch(root);
  return count;
};
\`\`\`

- **Understanding Traversal**:
- Visualizing how algorithms navigate through data structures helps in comprehending their functionality.
- Breaking down each step and counting operations can clarify complex processes.

## Linked Lists

- **Definition**:
- A linear data structure where each element (node) contains data and a reference (link) to the next node.

- **Building a Linked List**:
\`\`\`javascript
class ListItem {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.linkedTo = null;
  }

  setLinkedTo(listItem) {
    this.linkedTo = listItem;
  }

  getLinkedTo() {
    return this.linkedTo;
  }
}

let meta = new ListItem("meta");
let instagram = new ListItem("instagram");
let reels = new ListItem("reels");

// Linking nodes
instagram.setLinkedTo(reels);
meta.setLinkedTo(instagram);

class LinkedList {
  constructor(head) {
    this.head = head;
  }

  getLastItem() {
    let currentItem = this.head;
    while (currentItem.getLinkedTo()) {
      currentItem = currentItem.getLinkedTo();
    }
    return currentItem;
  }
}

let company = new LinkedList(meta);

// Outputs the last item in the list
console.log(company.getLastItem()); 
\`\`\`

- **Reversing a Linked List**:
\`\`\`javascript
reverse(head) {
  let previousItem = null;
  let currentItem = head;

  while (currentItem) {
    let nextItem = currentItem.getLinkedTo();
    currentItem.setLinkedTo(previousItem);
    previousItem = currentItem;
    currentItem = nextItem;
  }
  return previousItem;
}
\`\`\`

## Practice and Perseverance

- **Importance of Repetition**:
- Repeatedly practicing these concepts helps in making them second nature.
- Taking time to thoroughly understand foundational structures is crucial for tackling advanced topics.

- **Approach to Learning**:
- Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.

        seem to work faster with less rules. Robots Building Education uses open
        source protocols to allow for seamless decentralized, cross-platform and
        permissionless experiences.
        <br />
        <br />
        This means depositing Bitcoin and sending it is as easy as easy as
        scanning a QR code with a popular app like Cash App and answering a
        question. That's it! No more and no less is needed.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is a new way that the internet can work. It can be used and afford
        new experiences like the ability to publish progress across different
        apps, create scholarships with learning or even take your Bitcoin
        deposits to other places!

      //   The point of AI is to save you time and energy. At the same time, real
      //   education is about challenging yourself so that you can create real
      //   knowledge. In short, you'll work through 100+ questions and it will
      //   introduce you to building your ideas with software, learning computer
      //   science and creating opportunities for yourself with good technology.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   I also want to teach you quickly, effectively and in a similar fashion
      //   to you having to pick up the skills on the job. At the end of the day, a
      //   software entrepeneur needs to learn about business, engineering,
      //   investing, marketing, sales, design and a number of other well-rounded
      //   skills in order to be successful, which is what we try to prepare you
      //   here with.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   There are many things beyond coding taught on RO.B.E, ranging from the
      //   psychology of self-esteem, to the development of startups distributed
      //   globally. You are encouraged to imagine, think big and work hard in
      //   order to find success here.
      //   <br />
      //   <br /> The app is a service created by Robots Building Education, a
      //   platform founded on researching technology the following three
      //   priorities:
      //   <br /> <br />
      //   1. Every student should have access to many good teachers.
      //   <br />
      //   2. Online education should be the best education.
      //   <br />
      //   3. Learning creates scholarships.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   This is accomplished with the human-computer interaction discipline,
      //   which researches how to make technology more useful and meaningful. I
      //   personally revise anything done with AI to add human touch to it as to
      //   not offer cheap generated material but a genuine delivery of good
      //   quality education.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   The following are all the features and benefits you'll find across the
      //   platform which are typically free. As of now I just ask folks to
      //   optionally sign up for $10 to access more content around
      //   entrepreneurship, finance, and engineering to the work and to create a
      //   stronger network.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   Why so low for so much? I love education technology and I want to work
      //   on this platform until you feel it's worth supporting. I also believe
      //   that social media helps me reach so many people that keeping it low
      //   price is only fair. I would eventually like to explore teaching folks so
      //   we can create a pipeline to access more capital from folks eager to
      //   invest in diverse technology businesses.

        This platform will help you learn fast and effectively, but it is also

        have to embrace failure, mistakes and the improvement process. This
        platform isn't designed to be like Tiktok or Duolingo, where the
        material is handed to you in a way to maximize engagement, it's meant
        for you to learn and grow using the power of AI. In short, doing things
        the gritty way is often more enjoyable and meaningful. If you come
        across something confusing or tough, work through it! You'll be grateful
        you did.

    "landing.mission.paragraph3":

    faq_1_question: "¿Qué pasa con la IA?",
    faq_1_item_1:
      "Si la IA puede programarse a sí misma, es probable que todo el trabajo tal como lo conocemos cambie fundamentalmente. Pero por ahora, va a cambiar la oferta y la demanda de las cosas de manera relevante.",
    faq_1_item_2:
      "En mi opinión, la IA hace que la ingeniería de software sea más realista para más personas. Antes de la IA, estaba claro que se generaba una cantidad incontrolable de trabajo de tal manera que un ingeniero de software creaba más trabajo del que podía completar. Personalmente, encuentro más agradable escribir código con IA que sin ella y creo que hace que cosas como el emprendimiento sean más accesibles. Ahora, de verdad se pueden hacer las cosas.",
    faq_1_item_3:
      "Pensando críticamente, la IA se preocupa principalmente por tomar buenas decisiones. Así que los roles que dependen más de las decisiones se verán afectados. En mi opinión, esos son roles más ejecutivos, por lo que el punto óptimo hoy en día es ser un ingeniero junior o senior, de modo que puedas comenzar a construir negocios esbeltos por tu cuenta. Eso es lo que intentamos hacer aquí: te armamos con nuevas habilidades y esperamos que eso influya positivamente en tus decisiones u oportunidades.",
    faq_2_question: "¿Qué tipo de computadora necesito?",
    faq_2_item_1:
      "En cuanto al aprendizaje, recomiendo papel y lápiz. RO.B.E no es un programa intensivo en software. Se puede usar en tu dispositivo móvil o en cualquier portátil. A mí me gusta en los teléfonos móviles.",
    faq_2_item_2:
      "Si te preguntas qué tipo de computadora necesitas para programar, recomiendo un MacBook Pro. La siguiente mejor opción es la que puedas permitirte. Las personas suelen sobreanalizar esto y la verdad es que no necesitas nada lujoso. No hay respuesta incorrecta.",
    faq_2_item_3:
      "Los MacBook Pro son una buena solución general. Si necesitas algo especializado y estás seguro de tu inversión, entonces, en el mismo espíritu, invierte en la mejor potencia de cómputo que puedas conseguir.",
    faq_3_question:
      "¿Es difícil programar? ¿Necesito ser bueno en matemáticas?",
    faq_3_item_1: "Esta es una pregunta compleja.",
    faq_3_item_2:
      "No. No tienes que ser bueno en matemáticas. Y programar no es difícil, es un desafío. La educación es superar el desafío. Debes reconocer que puedes lograr las cosas que te propones.",
    faq_3_item_3:
      "Programar se trata de organizar información. Así que si puedes escribir instrucciones, puedes escribir código.",
    faq_3_item_4:
      "Tal vez hagas esa pregunta porque hay una parte de ti que desearía que alguien te dijera que se puede facilitar. La gente puede hacerlo más fácil. Va a ser un desafío, pero esa es también parte de la diversión.",
    faq_4_question: "¿Qué lenguaje de programación debo elegir?",
    faq_4_item_1:
      "Si ya has investigado un poco, probablemente te hayas topado con Python y JavaScript. Son muy populares por una razón, pero antes de explicar por qué, te recomiendo encarecidamente que pienses en qué tipo de máquinas quieres trabajar y qué tipo de problemas quieres resolver.",
    faq_4_item_2:
      "La razón por la que JavaScript y Python están tan extendidos es por internet. Se utilizan principalmente para realizar gran parte del trabajo de servicio de internet.",
    faq_4_item_3:
      "Pero, ¿qué pasa si necesitas una aplicación para iOS, una para Android, un videojuego o algún tipo de robot? Al final, descubrirás que cuando aprendes un lenguaje, en cierto modo aprendes todos. Hay una razón para eso, pero al final es como preocuparse por si deberías aprender a usar un martillo o un taladro al construir una casa: es probable que uses muchos lenguajes eventualmente y todo te resultará bastante familiar. No hay respuesta incorrecta.",
    faq_5_question: "¿Vale la pena un bootcamp?",
    faq_5_item_1:
      "Como de costumbre, la mejor respuesta es 'depende'. Lo que realmente pagas mucho dinero es por una red de empleo, y como has visto en los últimos años, ese tipo de negocio puede pasar por momentos difíciles.",
    faq_5_item_2:
      "No recomiendo asistir a un bootcamp como un atajo hacia la industria. Un bootcamp no es diferente a ser autodidacta o ir a la universidad. Aún tendrás que aprender habilidades relevantes, encontrar empleo en etapas tempranas, crear proyectos con sentido comercial y pasar entrevistas técnicas.",
    faq_5_item_3:
      "La forma en que abordes cada uno será muy diferente. Un desarrollador autodidacta en San Francisco es diferente a un estudiante de informática en Nebraska. Un desertor de Stanford tendrá un entorno distinto al de alguien en un colegio comunitario. Lo clave aquí es que tu entorno juega un papel importante en tus oportunidades.",
    faq_6_question: "¿Qué es programar y qué puedo hacer con ello?",
    faq_6_item_1:
      "Programar es una forma de organizar información. Por lo tanto, existe en todas partes. Piénsalo de esta manera: la programación la escriben los ingenieros de software para organizar información. Los ingenieros de software estudian ciencias de la computación. La computación es la ciencia de la resolución de problemas. Así que programar expresa la ciencia de resolver problemas.",
    faq_6_item_2:
      "Eso significa que puedes hacer prácticamente cualquier cosa. Puedes programar para medios, investigación médica, deportes, robots, sistemas energéticos, sistemas financieros o prácticamente cualquier cosa que se te ocurra. Sin duda, es una opción preferida para los emprendedores, pero muchas personas también adoptan un enfoque de vida equilibrado con ello. Así que, a veces, la gente programa porque quiere una vida más relajada también.",
    faq_7_question: "¿Soy demasiado mayor para aprender?",
    faq_7_item_1:
      "No. Simplemente, tu cerebro no funciona así. Es posible que experimentes algo de 'oxidación' si no has profundizado en el estudio de un tema en algún tiempo, pero eso no es muy diferente a un estudiante universitario que se da cuenta de que necesita aprender a aprender. Tal vez ya sepas cómo aprender o entiendas qué es lo que te funciona. Ahora, de repente, tienes una ventaja.",
    faq_7_item_2:
      "Como dice uno de mis directores, lento es suave y suave es rápido. Esto no es para crear un sentido de superioridad o inferioridad, simplemente estás en un mercado competitivo y generalmente es mejor adoptar una perspectiva productiva.",

## Enfoque de Aprendizaje

El proceso de aprendizaje consta de cuatro pasos clave:

1. **Imaginar e Ilustrar**: Visualiza conceptos para mejorar la comprensión.
2. **Establecer Conexiones y Relaciones**: Vincula nuevas ideas con conocimientos existentes.
3. **Observar Nueva Información**: Presta atención a nuevas ideas y datos.
4. **Practicar**: Aplica lo que has aprendido mediante actividades prácticas.

## Introducción

Las Estructuras de Datos y Algoritmos es una materia que a menudo intimida a los estudiantes debido a su complejidad y su uso en entrevistas desafiantes. Aunque es ciertamente desafiante y requiere práctica, con la orientación adecuada, los conceptos pueden volverse más accesibles.

## Lenguajes de Programación

- **Entendiendo la Interpretación del Código**:
  - Las computadoras interpretan el código descomponiéndolo en tokens y traduciéndolo a código máquina.
  - Ejemplo:
    \`\`\`javascript
    let musician = new Musician("Drake");
    let top_song = musician.getTopSong();
    \`\`\`
  - Los tokens en el código incluyen palabras clave (\`let\`, \`new\`), identificadores (\`musician\`, \`top_song\`, \`Musician\`), operadores (\`=\`) y literales (\`"Drake"\`).

- **Conversión de Cadenas**:
  - Las cadenas se descomponen en arrays de caracteres.
    - \`"Drake"\` se convierte en \`['D', 'r', 'a', 'k', 'e']\`.
  - Cada carácter se mapea a códigos numéricos (por ejemplo, ASCII o Unicode) y luego a representaciones binarias.

## Estructuras de Datos

- **Gestión de Memoria**:
  - Las computadoras reservan espacio en memoria y crean direcciones para referenciar información.
  - Comprender cómo se almacenan y referencian los datos es crucial para captar estructuras de datos complejas.

- **Listas Enlazadas**:
  - Una estructura de datos fundamental que ayuda a entender estructuras más complejas como árboles y grafos.
  - Representa una secuencia de nodos donde cada nodo apunta al siguiente.

## Árboles y Algoritmos

- **Recorridos de Árboles**:
  - **Búsqueda en Profundidad (DFS)**:
    - Explora lo más profundo posible a lo largo de cada rama antes de retroceder.
    - Útil en escenarios donde necesitas explorar todos los caminos posibles.

  - **Búsqueda en Anchura (BFS)**:
    - Explora todos los vecinos de un nodo antes de pasar al siguiente nivel.
    - Ideal para encontrar el camino más corto en grafos no ponderados.

- **Ejemplo de DFS Contando Nodos Nulos**:
  \`\`\`javascript
  let contarNulos = (raiz) => {
    let contador = 0;

    let busquedaEnProfundidad = (nodoActual) => {
      if (nodoActual === null) {
        contador++;
        return;
      }

      for (let siguienteNodo in nodoActual) {
        busquedaEnProfundidad(nodoActual[siguienteNodo]);
      }
    };

    busquedaEnProfundidad(raiz);
    return contador;
  };
  \`\`\`

- **Entendiendo el Recorrido**:
  - Visualizar cómo los algoritmos navegan a través de las estructuras de datos ayuda a comprender su funcionalidad.
  - Desglosar cada paso y contar operaciones puede aclarar procesos complejos.

## Listas Enlazadas

- **Definición**:
  - Una estructura de datos lineal donde cada elemento (nodo) contiene datos y una referencia (enlace) al siguiente nodo.

- **Construyendo una Lista Enlazada**:
  \`\`\`javascript
  class Nodo {
    constructor(valor) {
      this.valor = valor;
      this.enlace = null;
    }

    setEnlace(nodo) {
      this.enlace = nodo;
    }

    getEnlace() {
      return this.enlace;
    }
  }

  let meta = new Nodo("meta");
  let instagram = new Nodo("instagram");
  let reels = new Nodo("reels");

  // Enlazando nodos
  instagram.setEnlace(reels);
  meta.setEnlace(instagram);

  class ListaEnlazada {
    constructor(cabeza) {
      this.cabeza = cabeza;
    }

    getUltimoNodo() {
      let nodoActual = this.cabeza;
      while (nodoActual.getEnlace()) {
        nodoActual = nodoActual.getEnlace();
      }
      return nodoActual;
    }
  }

  let empresa = new ListaEnlazada(meta);
  console.log(empresa.getUltimoNodo()); // Muestra el último nodo de la lista
  \`\`\`

- **Revirtiendo una Lista Enlazada**:
  \`\`\`javascript
  reverse(cabeza) {
    let nodoPrevio = null;
    let nodoActual = cabeza;

    while (nodoActual) {
      let siguienteNodo = nodoActual.getEnlace();
      nodoActual.setEnlace(nodoPrevio);
      nodoPrevio = nodoActual;
      nodoActual = siguienteNodo;
    }
    return nodoPrevio;
  }
  \`\`\`

## Práctica y Perseverancia

- **Importancia de la Repetición**:
  - Practicar repetidamente estos conceptos ayuda a hacerlos naturales.
  - Tomarse el tiempo para entender a fondo las estructuras fundamentales es crucial para abordar temas avanzados.

- **Enfoque de Aprendizaje**:
  - Desglosa problemas complejos en partes más pequeñas y manejables.
  - Utiliza técnicas de visualización y conteo para seguir los pasos de los algoritmos.

        Esta plataforma te ayudará a aprender rápida y eficazmente, pero también
        está diseñada para desafiarte. La verdadera educación puede ser
        incómoda, y debes aceptar el fracaso, los errores y el proceso de
        mejora. Esta plataforma no está diseñada para ser como Tiktok o
        Duolingo, donde el material se te entrega de una manera que maximiza la
        interacción, sino que está pensada para que aprendas y crezcas usando el
        poder de la IA. En resumen, hacer las cosas de manera rigurosa a menudo
        es más gratificante y significativo. Si te encuentras con algo confuso o
        difícil, ¡trabájalo! Estarás agradecido de haberlo hecho.

        Esta plataforma viene con una tutora llamada Rox que te proporcionará
        videoconferencias introductorias, hechas a mano y animadas, para
        equiparte con conocimientos antes o después de practicar las preguntas
        de cada capítulo. Cada conferencia comienza trabajando hacia atrás, para
        que te acostumbres a apreciar el aprendizaje orientado a los desafíos.

      <div>
        El propósito de la IA es ahorrarte tiempo y energía. Al mismo tiempo, la
        educación real consiste en desafiarte a ti mismo para que puedas crear
        conocimiento verdadero. En resumen, trabajarás a través de más de 100
        preguntas y te introducirán a la construcción de tus ideas con software,
        aprendiendo ciencias de la computación y creando oportunidades para ti
        mismo con buena tecnología.
        <br />
        <br />
        También quiero enseñarte de manera rápida, efectiva y similar a cómo
        tendrías que adquirir habilidades en el trabajo. Al final del día, un
        emprendedor de software necesita aprender sobre negocios, ingeniería,
        inversión, marketing, ventas, diseño y una serie de otras habilidades
        completas para tener éxito, que es lo que intentamos prepararte aquí.
        <br />
        <br />
        En RO.B.E. se enseñan muchas cosas más allá de la codificación, que van
        desde la psicología de la autoestima hasta el desarrollo de startups
        distribuidas globalmente. Se te anima a imaginar, pensar en grande y
        trabajar duro para encontrar el éxito aquí.
        <br />
        <br />
        El Programa AI App es un servicio creado por Robots Building Education,
        una plataforma fundada en la investigación de tecnología con las
        siguientes tres prioridades:
        <br />
        <br />
        1. Todo estudiante debería tener acceso a muchos buenos maestros.
        <br />
        2. La educación en línea debería ser la mejor educación.
        <br />
        3. Aprender crea becas.
        <br />
        <br />
        Esto se logra con la disciplina de la interacción humano-computadora,
        que investiga cómo hacer que la tecnología sea más útil y significativa.
        Yo personalmente reviso cualquier cosa hecha con IA para añadirle un
        toque humano, de modo que no ofrezca material generado de manera barata,
        sino una entrega genuina de educación de buena calidad.
        <br />
        <br />
        A continuación se encuentran todas las características y beneficios que
        encontrarás en la plataforma, que típicamente son gratuitos. Por ahora,
        solo pido a las personas que opcionalmente se inscriban por $10 para
        acceder a más contenido relacionado con el emprendimiento, finanzas e
        ingeniería, y para crear una red más fuerte.
        <br />
        <br />
        ¿Por qué tan bajo precio por tanto? Me encanta la tecnología educativa y
        quiero trabajar en esta plataforma hasta que sientas que vale la pena
        apoyarla. También creo que las redes sociales me ayudan a llegar a
        muchas personas, por lo que mantener el precio bajo es lo justo.
        Eventualmente me gustaría explorar la enseñanza para que podamos crear
        un canal de acceso a más capital de personas deseosas de invertir en
        negocios tecnológicos diversos.

    faq_1_item_1:
      "If AI can program themselves, it's likely that all work as we know it will fundamentally change. But for now, it's going to change the supply and demand of things in a relevant way.",
    faq_1_item_2:
      "In my view, AI makes software engineering more realistic for more people. Before AI, it was clear that there was an unmanageable amount of work being generated in a way where a software engineer would create more work than they could complete. So I personally find it more enjoyable to write code with AI than without it and I believe that it makes more things like entrepreneurship more accessible. Things can actually get done now.",
    faq_1_item_3:
      "Thinking critically, AI is mostly concerned with making good decisions. So roles that depend more on decisions will be impacted. In my view, that's more executive roles, thus the sweetspot these days is being a junior or senior engineer so you could start to build lean businesses on your own. So that's what we try to do here - we arm you with new skills and hope that it influences your decisions or opportunities in a good way.",
    faq_2_question: "What kind of computer do I need?",
    faq_2_item_1:
      "When it comes to learning, I recommend paper and pencil. RO.B.E is not a software intensive program. It can be used on your mobile device or any laptop. I like it on mobile phones.",
    faq_2_item_2:
      "If you're wondering what kind of computer you need to code, I recommend a macbook pro. The next best answer is whatever you can afford. People usually overthink this and the truth is you don't need anything fancy. There's no wrong answer.",
    faq_2_item_3:
      "Macbook pros are good general solution. If you need something specialized and you're certain about your investment, then in a similar spirit, invest in the best computing power you can get.",
    faq_3_question: "Is coding hard? Do I need to be good at math?",
    faq_3_item_1: "This is a loaded question.",
    faq_3_item_2:
      "No. You don't have to be good at math. And programming isn't hard, it's challenging. Education IS overcoming the challenge. You should recognize that you can accomplish the things you want to accomplish.",
    faq_3_item_3:
      "Coding is about organizing information. So if you can write instructions, you can write code.",
    faq_3_item_4:
      "So maybe you ask that question because there's a part of you that wishes someone would tell you that it can be made easy. People can make it easier. It's going to be a challenge, but that's part of the fun too.",
    faq_4_question: "What programming language should I pick?",
    faq_4_item_1:
      "So if you've done any research already, you've probably come across Python and Javascript. They're very popular for a reason, but before explaining why, I strongly recommend to think about what kind of machines you want to work on and what kind of problems you want to solve.",
    faq_4_item_2:
      "The reason Javascript and Python are so widespread is because of the internet. They're mostly used to do a lot of the service work of the internet.",
    faq_4_item_3:
      "But what if you need an iOS app, an android one, a video game, or some kind of robot? Ultimately you'll find that when you learn one language, you kinda learn them all. There's a reason for that, but ultimately it's like worrying whether you should learn how to use a hammer or drill when building a home - you're likely going to use many languages eventually and it'll all feel pretty familiar. There's no wrong answer.",
    faq_5_question: "Is a bootcamp worth it?",
    faq_5_item_1:
      "As usual, the best answer is going to be 'it depends'. What you really pay a lot of money for is an employment network, and as you've seen in recent years, that kind of business can experience hard times.",
    faq_5_item_2:
      "I don't recommend going to a bootcamp as a shortcut into the industry. A bootcamp is no different than being self-taught or going to college. You will still need to learn relevant skills, find early-stage employment, create business-savvy projects and pass technical interviews.",
    faq_5_item_3:
      "How you approach each will be wildly different. A self-taught developer in San Francisco is different than a computer science student in Nebraska. A dropout from Stanford will have a different environment than someone at a community college. The key thing here is that your environment plays an important role in your opportunities.",
    faq_6_question: "What is coding and what can I do with it?",
    faq_6_item_1:
      "Coding is a way to organize information. So it exists everywhere. Think of it this way. Coding is written by software engineers to organize information. Software engineers study computer science. Computer science is the science of computation. Computation is problem solving. So coding expresses the science of solving problems.",
    faq_6_item_2:
      "That means you can do just about anything. You can code for media, medicine research, sports, robots, energy systems, financial systems or just about anything you can think of. It's certainly a preferred game for entrepreneurs, but many people also take the well-balanced life approach with it too. So sometimes people code because they want a more relaxed life too.",
    faq_7_question: "Am I too old to learn?",
    faq_7_item_1:
      "No. Simply put, your brain doesn't work that way. You may experience some 'rustyness' if you haven't done deep learning of a subject in some time, but that's not too different than a college student realizing that they need to learn how to learn. Maybe you already know how to learn or you understand what works for you. Now suddenly you have an advantage.",
    faq_7_item_2:
      "As one of my directors say, slow is smooth and smooth is fast. This isn't to create any sense of superiority or inferiority - you're just in a competitive market and it's usually better to take the productive outlook.",

## Overview

This lecture introduces the fundamentals of coding, focusing on:

- **Objects**
- **Functions**
- **Loops**
- **Data and Logic**
- **Network Functions**

The approach is to start with more challenging concepts and work down to the basics, catering to learners from diverse backgrounds.

## Objects

- **Definition**: Objects in code model the digital world using information, data, and logic.
- **Classes**: Define how objects are created, including their state and functionality.
- **Key Point**: Objects have a common way to define their state and manage it through functionality.
- **Examples**:
  - Creating a \`Robot\` class in JavaScript.
  - Using objects to structure data in applications like social media posts or crypto transactions.
- **Takeaway**: Coding is about organizing information, not about math.

## Functions

- **Purpose**: Essential for organizing and handling data.
- **Types**:
  - **Synchronous Functions**: Execute tasks sequentially (like cooking in a pan).
  - **Asynchronous Functions**: Allow other processes to run concurrently (like cooking in an oven).
- **Importance**: Understanding functions helps manage data flow, especially when handling data across networks.

## Loops

- **Usage**: Perform repeatable actions on groups of data.
- **Types of Looping Functions**:
  - Transforming values.
  - Filtering values.
  - Reversing values.
- **Example**: Using \`forEach\` in JavaScript to find an artist with the highest Spotify monthly listeners.
- **Documentation**: Encouraged to read language documentation to understand built-in methods and functionalities.

## Data and Logic

- **Fundamentals**:
  - Data types include words, numbers, groups, and logical conclusions.
  - Logic boils down to true or false values—how computers interpret the world.
- **Examples**:
  - Defining objects like \`obama\` and \`elon\` with properties.
  - Creating functions that use logical conditions to return results.
- **Key Point**: Individual pieces of data create logic; groups of data create functionality.

## Coding and Logic (Reinforced)

- **Coding**: The organization of information.
- **Logic**: Determining if statements are true or false.
- **Real-World Connection**: Observing how everyday items and situations can be represented in code.
- **Encouragement**: Understand that coding concepts can be grasped without heavy emphasis on math.

## Practice and Learning Strategies

- **Use AI Assistance**: Utilize AI tools like ChatGPT for guidance.
- **Hands-On Practice**:
  - Write code by hand on paper.
  - Draw connections and visualize data structures.
- **Model Real-World Data**: Practice representing real-world scenarios as data models in code.
- **Mindset**: Focus on learning and understanding rather than worrying about right or wrong.

Data Structures and Algorithms is a subject that often intimidates students due to its complexity and its use in challenging interviews. While it is indeed challenging and requires practice, with proper guidance, the concepts can become more approachable.

## Programming Languages

- **Understanding Code Interpretation**:
- Computers interpret code by breaking it down into tokens and translating it into machine code.
- Example:
  \`\`\`javascript
  let musician = new Musician("Drake");
  
  let top_song = musician.getTopSong();
  \`\`\`
- Tokens in the code include keywords (let, new), identifiers (musician, top_song, Musician), operators (=), and literals ("Drake").

- **String Conversion**:
- Strings are broken down into arrays of characters.
  - "Drake" becomes \`['D', 'r', 'a', 'k', 'e']\`.
- Each character is mapped to numerical codes (e.g., ASCII or Unicode) and then to binary representations.

## Data Structures

- **Memory Management**:
- Computers reserve space in memory and create addresses to reference information.
- Understanding how data is stored and referenced is crucial for grasping complex data structures.

- **Linked Lists**:
- A foundational data structure that helps in understanding more complex structures like trees and graphs.
- Represents a sequence of nodes where each node points to the next.

## Trees and Algorithms

- **Traversing Trees**:
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
  - Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
  - Useful for scenarios where you need to explore all possible paths.

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
  - Explores all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level.
  - Ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

- **Example of DFS Counting Null Nodes**:
\`\`\`javascript
let countNull = (root) => {
  let count = 0;

  let depthFirstSearch = (currentRoot) => {
    if (currentRoot === null) {
      count++;
      return;
    }

    for (let nextLocation in currentRoot) {
      depthFirstSearch(currentRoot[nextLocation]);
    }
  };

  depthFirstSearch(root);
  return count;
};
\`\`\`

- **Understanding Traversal**:
- Visualizing how algorithms navigate through data structures helps in comprehending their functionality.
- Breaking down each step and counting operations can clarify complex processes.

## Linked Lists

- **Definition**:
- A linear data structure where each element (node) contains data and a reference (link) to the next node.

- **Building a Linked List**:
\`\`\`javascript
class ListItem {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.linkedTo = null;
  }

  setLinkedTo(listItem) {
    this.linkedTo = listItem;
  }

  getLinkedTo() {
    return this.linkedTo;
  }
}

let meta = new ListItem("meta");
let instagram = new ListItem("instagram");
let reels = new ListItem("reels");

// Linking nodes
instagram.setLinkedTo(reels);
meta.setLinkedTo(instagram);

class LinkedList {
  constructor(head) {
    this.head = head;
  }

  getLastItem() {
    let currentItem = this.head;
    while (currentItem.getLinkedTo()) {
      currentItem = currentItem.getLinkedTo();
    }
    return currentItem;
  }
}

let company = new LinkedList(meta);

// Outputs the last item in the list
console.log(company.getLastItem()); 
\`\`\`

- **Reversing a Linked List**:
\`\`\`javascript
reverse(head) {
  let previousItem = null;
  let currentItem = head;

  while (currentItem) {
    let nextItem = currentItem.getLinkedTo();
    currentItem.setLinkedTo(previousItem);
    previousItem = currentItem;
    currentItem = nextItem;
  }
  return previousItem;
}
\`\`\`

## Practice and Perseverance

      <div>
        Think about how communities fund schools. People work, create income and
        have that incomed taxed in a number of ways to provide the budgets and
        funds for schools. This eventually creates walled gardens and
        inequities.
        <br />
        <br />
        Robots Building Education is a platform using protocols that introduces
        new ways to provide funds for education by connecting participants
        beyond neighborhood lines. When students learn, real economic value is
        created. We believe this should be represented by creating material and
        resilient outcomes for communities so when you answer questions, Bitcoin
        gets automatically sent to recipients you select in the form of
        scholarships.
        <br />
        <br />
        You might notice that this app is a little different than others. Things
        seem to work faster with less rules. Robots Building Education uses open
        source protocols to allow for seamless decentralized, cross-platform and
        permissionless experiences.
        <br />
        <br />
        This means depositing Bitcoin and sending it is as easy as easy as
        scanning a QR code with a popular app like Cash App and answering a
        question. That's it! No more and no less is needed.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is a new way that the internet can work. It can be used and afford
        new experiences like the ability to publish progress across different
        apps, create scholarships with learning or even take your Bitcoin
        deposits to other places!
      </div>
      // <div>
      //   The point of AI is to save you time and energy. At the same time, real
      //   education is about challenging yourself so that you can create real
      //   knowledge. In short, you'll work through 100+ questions and it will
      //   introduce you to building your ideas with software, learning computer
      //   science and creating opportunities for yourself with good technology.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   I also want to teach you quickly, effectively and in a similar fashion
      //   to you having to pick up the skills on the job. At the end of the day, a
      //   software entrepeneur needs to learn about business, engineering,
      //   investing, marketing, sales, design and a number of other well-rounded
      //   skills in order to be successful, which is what we try to prepare you
      //   here with.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   There are many things beyond coding taught on RO.B.E, ranging from the
      //   psychology of self-esteem, to the development of startups distributed
      //   globally. You are encouraged to imagine, think big and work hard in
      //   order to find success here.
      //   <br />
      //   <br /> The app is a service created by Robots Building Education, a
      //   platform founded on researching technology the following three
      //   priorities:
      //   <br /> <br />
      //   1. Every student should have access to many good teachers.
      //   <br />
      //   2. Online education should be the best education.
      //   <br />
      //   3. Learning creates scholarships.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   This is accomplished with the human-computer interaction discipline,
      //   which researches how to make technology more useful and meaningful. I
      //   personally revise anything done with AI to add human touch to it as to
      //   not offer cheap generated material but a genuine delivery of good
      //   quality education.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   The following are all the features and benefits you'll find across the
      //   platform which are typically free. As of now I just ask folks to
      //   optionally sign up for $10 to access more content around
      //   entrepreneurship, finance, and engineering to the work and to create a
      //   stronger network.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   Why so low for so much? I love education technology and I want to work
      //   on this platform until you feel it's worth supporting. I also believe
      //   that social media helps me reach so many people that keeping it low
      //   price is only fair. I would eventually like to explore teaching folks so
      //   we can create a pipeline to access more capital from folks eager to
      //   invest in diverse technology businesses.

        This platform will help you learn fast and effectively, but it is also

        for you to learn and grow using the power of AI. In short, doing things
        the gritty way is often more enjoyable and meaningful. If you come

      "If AI can program themselves, it's likely that all work as we know it will fundamentally change. But for now, it's going to change the supply and demand of things in a relevant way.",
    faq_1_item_2:
      "In my view, AI makes software engineering more realistic for more people. Before AI, it was clear that there was an unmanageable amount of work being generated in a way where a software engineer would create more work than they could complete. So I personally find it more enjoyable to write code with AI than without it and I believe that it makes more things like entrepreneurship more accessible. Things can actually get done now.",
    faq_1_item_3:
      "Thinking critically, AI is mostly concerned with making good decisions. So roles that depend more on decisions will be impacted. In my view, that's more executive roles, thus the sweetspot these days is being a junior or senior engineer so you could start to build lean businesses on your own. So that's what we try to do here - we arm you with new skills and hope that it influences your decisions or opportunities in a good way.",
    faq_2_question: "What kind of computer do I need?",
    faq_2_item_1:
      "When it comes to learning, I recommend paper and pencil. RO.B.E is not a software intensive program. It can be used on your mobile device or any laptop. I like it on mobile phones.",
    faq_2_item_2:
      "If you're wondering what kind of computer you need to code, I recommend a macbook pro. The next best answer is whatever you can afford. People usually overthink this and the truth is you don't need anything fancy. There's no wrong answer.",
    faq_2_item_3:
      "Macbook pros are good general solution. If you need something specialized and you're certain about your investment, then in a similar spirit, invest in the best computing power you can get.",
    faq_3_question: "Is coding hard? Do I need to be good at math?",
    faq_3_item_1: "This is a loaded question.",
    faq_3_item_2:
      "No. You don't have to be good at math. And programming isn't hard, it's challenging. Education IS overcoming the challenge. You should recognize that you can accomplish the things you want to accomplish.",
    faq_3_item_3:
      "Coding is about organizing information. So if you can write instructions, you can write code.",
    faq_3_item_4:
      "So maybe you ask that question because there's a part of you that wishes someone would tell you that it can be made easy. People can make it easier. It's going to be a challenge, but that's part of the fun too.",
    faq_4_question: "What programming language should I pick?",
    faq_4_item_1:
      "So if you've done any research already, you've probably come across Python and Javascript. They're very popular for a reason, but before explaining why, I strongly recommend to think about what kind of machines you want to work on and what kind of problems you want to solve.",
    faq_4_item_2:
      "The reason Javascript and Python are so widespread is because of the internet. They're mostly used to do a lot of the service work of the internet.",
    faq_4_item_3:
      "But what if you need an iOS app, an android one, a video game, or some kind of robot? Ultimately you'll find that when you learn one language, you kinda learn them all. There's a reason for that, but ultimately it's like worrying whether you should learn how to use a hammer or drill when building a home - you're likely going to use many languages eventually and it'll all feel pretty familiar. There's no wrong answer.",
    faq_5_question: "Is a bootcamp worth it?",
    faq_5_item_1:
      "As usual, the best answer is going to be 'it depends'. What you really pay a lot of money for is an employment network, and as you've seen in recent years, that kind of business can experience hard times.",
    faq_5_item_2:
      "I don't recommend going to a bootcamp as a shortcut into the industry. A bootcamp is no different than being self-taught or going to college. You will still need to learn relevant skills, find early-stage employment, create business-savvy projects and pass technical interviews.",
    faq_5_item_3:
      "How you approach each will be wildly different. A self-taught developer in San Francisco is different than a computer science student in Nebraska. A dropout from Stanford will have a different environment than someone at a community college. The key thing here is that your environment plays an important role in your opportunities.",
    faq_6_question: "What is coding and what can I do with it?",
    faq_6_item_1:
      "Coding is a way to organize information. So it exists everywhere. Think of it this way. Coding is written by software engineers to organize information. Software engineers study computer science. Computer science is the science of computation. Computation is problem solving. So coding expresses the science of solving problems.",
    faq_6_item_2:
      "That means you can do just about anything. You can code for media, medicine research, sports, robots, energy systems, financial systems or just about anything you can think of. It's certainly a preferred game for entrepreneurs, but many people also take the well-balanced life approach with it too. So sometimes people code because they want a more relaxed life too.",
    faq_7_question: "Am I too old to learn?",
    faq_7_item_1:
      "No. Simply put, your brain doesn't work that way. You may experience some 'rustyness' if you haven't done deep learning of a subject in some time, but that's not too different than a college student realizing that they need to learn how to learn. Maybe you already know how to learn or you understand what works for you. Now suddenly you have an advantage.",
    faq_7_item_2:
      "As one of my directors say, slow is smooth and smooth is fast. This isn't to create any sense of superiority or inferiority - you're just in a competitive market and it's usually better to take the productive outlook.",

## Overview

This lecture introduces the fundamentals of coding, focusing on:

- **Objects**
- **Functions**
- **Loops**
- **Data and Logic**
- **Network Functions**

The approach is to start with more challenging concepts and work down to the basics, catering to learners from diverse backgrounds.

## Objects

- **Definition**: Objects in code model the digital world using information, data, and logic.
- **Classes**: Define how objects are created, including their state and functionality.
- **Key Point**: Objects have a common way to define their state and manage it through functionality.
- **Examples**:
  - Creating a \`Robot\` class in JavaScript.
  - Using objects to structure data in applications like social media posts or crypto transactions.
- **Takeaway**: Coding is about organizing information, not about math.

## Functions

- **Purpose**: Essential for organizing and handling data.
- **Types**:
  - **Synchronous Functions**: Execute tasks sequentially (like cooking in a pan).
  - **Asynchronous Functions**: Allow other processes to run concurrently (like cooking in an oven).
- **Importance**: Understanding functions helps manage data flow, especially when handling data across networks.

## Loops

- **Usage**: Perform repeatable actions on groups of data.
- **Types of Looping Functions**:
  - Transforming values.
  - Filtering values.
  - Reversing values.
- **Example**: Using \`forEach\` in JavaScript to find an artist with the highest Spotify monthly listeners.
- **Documentation**: Encouraged to read language documentation to understand built-in methods and functionalities.

## Data and Logic

- **Fundamentals**:
  - Data types include words, numbers, groups, and logical conclusions.
  - Logic boils down to true or false values—how computers interpret the world.
- **Examples**:
  - Defining objects like \`obama\` and \`elon\` with properties.
  - Creating functions that use logical conditions to return results.
- **Key Point**: Individual pieces of data create logic; groups of data create functionality.

## Coding and Logic (Reinforced)

- **Coding**: The organization of information.
- **Logic**: Determining if statements are true or false.
- **Real-World Connection**: Observing how everyday items and situations can be represented in code.
- **Encouragement**: Understand that coding concepts can be grasped without heavy emphasis on math.

## Practice and Learning Strategies

- **Use AI Assistance**: Utilize AI tools like ChatGPT for guidance.
- **Hands-On Practice**:
  - Write code by hand on paper.
  - Draw connections and visualize data structures.
- **Model Real-World Data**: Practice representing real-world scenarios as data models in code.
- **Mindset**: Focus on learning and understanding rather than worrying about right or wrong.

## Conclusion

- **Main Takeaways**:
  - Coding models the digital world with information, data, and logic.
  - Organizing information is the essence of coding.
  - Logic in coding is about true or false values.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Prepare to build visual applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
- **Encouragement**:
  - Slow down and internalize the lessons.
  - Embrace challenges and trust the learning process.
  - Practice consistently to strengthen your skills.

## React Components

- **Components**: Functions that return UI elements and manage their own state and properties.
- **Main Parts of a React Component**:
  1. **Hooks**: Functions that handle and synchronize operations with the component's state (e.g., \`useState\`).
  2. **State**: Dynamic data within the component that changes over time, triggering re-renders.
  3. **Properties (Props)**: Data passed into the component that should remain unchanged within it.

- **Event-Based Programming**: React components respond to user interactions (events) that trigger state changes and UI updates.

## Data Flow in React

- React uses a **one-way data flow**, making it intuitive to design relationships and manage data.
- **Updating State**: Changing a component's state refreshes the display and re-renders the component.
- **Props vs. State**:
  - **Props**: Immutable data received from parent components.
  - **State**: Mutable data managed within the component.

## Practical Example: Tweet Component

- Demonstrated a \`Tweet\` component that displays tweet information and handles user interactions like likes.
- Showed how to:
  - Use hooks (\`useState\`) to manage state.
  - Pass functions and data as props to child components.
  - Update state in response to events (e.g., \`createLike\` function).

## Overcoming Challenges

- **Elements and Attributes**:
  - **Events**: Handle user interactions like clicks and hovers.
  - **ID**: Unique identifier for elements.
  - **Class**: Groups elements for styling.
  - **Style**: Inline styling of elements.

- Recommended thinking of HTML elements as containers organized logically.

## CSS and Styling Elements

- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Styles the appearance of HTML elements.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Box Model**: Shapes elements using properties like \`margin\`, \`padding\`, \`border\`, and \`width\`.
  - **Flexbox Model**: Positions elements in rows or columns for responsive design.
  - **Animation Model**: Animates elements using CSS animations or JavaScript.

- Suggested using inline styles or CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled-Components with React for better control.

## Combining Concepts

- Provided examples of combining React components with HTML and CSS to create interactive UI elements.
- Showed how to use state and event handlers to manage data and user interactions.
- Emphasized the importance of understanding how these technologies work together.

## Practice and Learning

Data Structures and Algorithms is a subject that often intimidates students due to its complexity and its use in challenging interviews. While it is indeed challenging and requires practice, with proper guidance, the concepts can become more approachable.

## Programming Languages

- **Understanding Code Interpretation**:
- Computers interpret code by breaking it down into tokens and translating it into machine code.
- Example:
  \`\`\`javascript
  let musician = new Musician("Drake");
  
  let top_song = musician.getTopSong();
  \`\`\`
- Tokens in the code include keywords (let, new), identifiers (musician, top_song, Musician), operators (=), and literals ("Drake").

- **String Conversion**:
- Strings are broken down into arrays of characters.
  - "Drake" becomes \`['D', 'r', 'a', 'k', 'e']\`.
- Each character is mapped to numerical codes (e.g., ASCII or Unicode) and then to binary representations.

## Data Structures

- **Memory Management**:
- Computers reserve space in memory and create addresses to reference information.
- Understanding how data is stored and referenced is crucial for grasping complex data structures.

- **Linked Lists**:
- A foundational data structure that helps in understanding more complex structures like trees and graphs.
- Represents a sequence of nodes where each node points to the next.

## Trees and Algorithms

- **Traversing Trees**:
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
  - Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
  - Useful for scenarios where you need to explore all possible paths.

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
  - Explores all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level.
  - Ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

- **Example of DFS Counting Null Nodes**:
\`\`\`javascript
let countNull = (root) => {
  let count = 0;

  let depthFirstSearch = (currentRoot) => {
    if (currentRoot === null) {
      count++;
      return;
    }

    for (let nextLocation in currentRoot) {
      depthFirstSearch(currentRoot[nextLocation]);
    }
  };

  depthFirstSearch(root);
  return count;
};
\`\`\`

- **Understanding Traversal**:
- Visualizing how algorithms navigate through data structures helps in comprehending their functionality.
- Breaking down each step and counting operations can clarify complex processes.

## Linked Lists

- **Definition**:
- A linear data structure where each element (node) contains data and a reference (link) to the next node.

- **Building a Linked List**:
\`\`\`javascript
class ListItem {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.linkedTo = null;
  }

  setLinkedTo(listItem) {
    this.linkedTo = listItem;
  }

  getLinkedTo() {
    return this.linkedTo;
  }
}

let meta = new ListItem("meta");
let instagram = new ListItem("instagram");
let reels = new ListItem("reels");

// Linking nodes
instagram.setLinkedTo(reels);
meta.setLinkedTo(instagram);

class LinkedList {
  constructor(head) {
    this.head = head;
  }

  getLastItem() {
    let currentItem = this.head;
    while (currentItem.getLinkedTo()) {
      currentItem = currentItem.getLinkedTo();
    }
    return currentItem;
  }
}

let company = new LinkedList(meta);

// Outputs the last item in the list
console.log(company.getLastItem()); 
\`\`\`

- **Reversing a Linked List**:
\`\`\`javascript
reverse(head) {
  let previousItem = null;
  let currentItem = head;

  while (currentItem) {
    let nextItem = currentItem.getLinkedTo();
    currentItem.setLinkedTo(previousItem);
    previousItem = currentItem;
    currentItem = nextItem;
  }
  return previousItem;
}
\`\`\`

## Practice and Perseverance

      <div>
        Think about how communities fund schools. People work, create income and
        have that incomed taxed in a number of ways to provide the budgets and
        funds for schools. This eventually creates walled gardens and
        inequities.
        <br />
        <br />
        Robots Building Education is a platform using protocols that introduces
        new ways to provide funds for education by connecting participants
        beyond neighborhood lines. When students learn, real economic value is
        created. We believe this should be represented by creating material and
        resilient outcomes for communities so when you answer questions, Bitcoin
        gets automatically sent to recipients you select in the form of
        scholarships.
        <br />
        <br />
        You might notice that this app is a little different than others. Things
        seem to work faster with less rules. Robots Building Education uses open
        source protocols to allow for seamless decentralized, cross-platform and
        permissionless experiences.
        <br />
        <br />
        This means depositing Bitcoin and sending it is as easy as easy as
        scanning a QR code with a popular app like Cash App and answering a
        question. That's it! No more and no less is needed.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is a new way that the internet can work. It can be used and afford
        new experiences like the ability to publish progress across different
        apps, create scholarships with learning or even take your Bitcoin
        deposits to other places!
      </div>
      // <div>
      //   The point of AI is to save you time and energy. At the same time, real
      //   education is about challenging yourself so that you can create real
      //   knowledge. In short, you'll work through 100+ questions and it will
      //   introduce you to building your ideas with software, learning computer
      //   science and creating opportunities for yourself with good technology.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   I also want to teach you quickly, effectively and in a similar fashion
      //   to you having to pick up the skills on the job. At the end of the day, a
      //   software entrepeneur needs to learn about business, engineering,
      //   investing, marketing, sales, design and a number of other well-rounded
      //   skills in order to be successful, which is what we try to prepare you
      //   here with.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   There are many things beyond coding taught on RO.B.E, ranging from the
      //   psychology of self-esteem, to the development of startups distributed
      //   globally. You are encouraged to imagine, think big and work hard in
      //   order to find success here.
      //   <br />
      //   <br /> The app is a service created by Robots Building Education, a
      //   platform founded on researching technology the following three
      //   priorities:
      //   <br /> <br />
      //   1. Every student should have access to many good teachers.
      //   <br />
      //   2. Online education should be the best education.
      //   <br />
      //   3. Learning creates scholarships.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   This is accomplished with the human-computer interaction discipline,
      //   which researches how to make technology more useful and meaningful. I
      //   personally revise anything done with AI to add human touch to it as to
      //   not offer cheap generated material but a genuine delivery of good
      //   quality education.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   The following are all the features and benefits you'll find across the
      //   platform which are typically free. As of now I just ask folks to
      //   optionally sign up for $10 to access more content around
      //   entrepreneurship, finance, and engineering to the work and to create a
      //   stronger network.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   Why so low for so much? I love education technology and I want to work
      //   on this platform until you feel it's worth supporting. I also believe
      //   that social media helps me reach so many people that keeping it low
      //   price is only fair. I would eventually like to explore teaching folks so
      //   we can create a pipeline to access more capital from folks eager to
      //   invest in diverse technology businesses.

        for you to learn and grow using the power of AI. In short, doing things
        the gritty way is often more enjoyable and meaningful. If you come

      "If AI can program themselves, it's likely that all work as we know it will fundamentally change. But for now, it's going to change the supply and demand of things in a relevant way.",
    faq_1_item_2:
      "In my view, AI makes software engineering more realistic for more people. Before AI, it was clear that there was an unmanageable amount of work being generated in a way where a software engineer would create more work than they could complete. So I personally find it more enjoyable to write code with AI than without it and I believe that it makes more things like entrepreneurship more accessible. Things can actually get done now.",
    faq_1_item_3:
      "Thinking critically, AI is mostly concerned with making good decisions. So roles that depend more on decisions will be impacted. In my view, that's more executive roles, thus the sweetspot these days is being a junior or senior engineer so you could start to build lean businesses on your own. So that's what we try to do here - we arm you with new skills and hope that it influences your decisions or opportunities in a good way.",
    faq_2_question: "What kind of computer do I need?",
    faq_2_item_1:
      "When it comes to learning, I recommend paper and pencil. RO.B.E is not a software intensive program. It can be used on your mobile device or any laptop. I like it on mobile phones.",
    faq_2_item_2:
      "If you're wondering what kind of computer you need to code, I recommend a macbook pro. The next best answer is whatever you can afford. People usually overthink this and the truth is you don't need anything fancy. There's no wrong answer.",
    faq_2_item_3:
      "Macbook pros are good general solution. If you need something specialized and you're certain about your investment, then in a similar spirit, invest in the best computing power you can get.",
    faq_3_question: "Is coding hard? Do I need to be good at math?",
    faq_3_item_1: "This is a loaded question.",
    faq_3_item_2:
      "No. You don't have to be good at math. And programming isn't hard, it's challenging. Education IS overcoming the challenge. You should recognize that you can accomplish the things you want to accomplish.",
    faq_3_item_3:
      "Coding is about organizing information. So if you can write instructions, you can write code.",
    faq_3_item_4:
      "So maybe you ask that question because there's a part of you that wishes someone would tell you that it can be made easy. People can make it easier. It's going to be a challenge, but that's part of the fun too.",
    faq_4_question: "What programming language should I pick?",
    faq_4_item_1:
      "So if you've done any research already, you've probably come across Python and Javascript. They're very popular for a reason, but before explaining why, I strongly recommend to think about what kind of machines you want to work on and what kind of problems you want to solve.",
    faq_4_item_2:
      "The reason Javascript and Python are so widespread is because of the internet. They're mostly used to do a lot of the service work of the internet.",
    faq_4_item_3:
      "But what if you need an iOS app, an android one, a video game, or some kind of robot? Ultimately you'll find that when you learn one language, you kinda learn them all. There's a reason for that, but ultimately it's like worrying whether you should learn how to use a hammer or drill when building a home - you're likely going to use many languages eventually and it'll all feel pretty familiar. There's no wrong answer.",
    faq_5_question: "Is a bootcamp worth it?",
    faq_5_item_1:
      "As usual, the best answer is going to be 'it depends'. What you really pay a lot of money for is an employment network, and as you've seen in recent years, that kind of business can experience hard times.",
    faq_5_item_2:
      "I don't recommend going to a bootcamp as a shortcut into the industry. A bootcamp is no different than being self-taught or going to college. You will still need to learn relevant skills, find early-stage employment, create business-savvy projects and pass technical interviews.",
    faq_5_item_3:
      "How you approach each will be wildly different. A self-taught developer in San Francisco is different than a computer science student in Nebraska. A dropout from Stanford will have a different environment than someone at a community college. The key thing here is that your environment plays an important role in your opportunities.",
    faq_6_question: "What is coding and what can I do with it?",
    faq_6_item_1:
      "Coding is a way to organize information. So it exists everywhere. Think of it this way. Coding is written by software engineers to organize information. Software engineers study computer science. Computer science is the science of computation. Computation is problem solving. So coding expresses the science of solving problems.",
    faq_6_item_2:
      "That means you can do just about anything. You can code for media, medicine research, sports, robots, energy systems, financial systems or just about anything you can think of. It's certainly a preferred game for entrepreneurs, but many people also take the well-balanced life approach with it too. So sometimes people code because they want a more relaxed life too.",
    faq_7_question: "Am I too old to learn?",
    faq_7_item_1:
      "No. Simply put, your brain doesn't work that way. You may experience some 'rustyness' if you haven't done deep learning of a subject in some time, but that's not too different than a college student realizing that they need to learn how to learn. Maybe you already know how to learn or you understand what works for you. Now suddenly you have an advantage.",
    faq_7_item_2:
      "As one of my directors say, slow is smooth and smooth is fast. This isn't to create any sense of superiority or inferiority - you're just in a competitive market and it's usually better to take the productive outlook.",

## Overview

This lecture introduces the fundamentals of coding, focusing on:

- **Objects**
- **Functions**
- **Loops**
- **Data and Logic**
- **Network Functions**

The approach is to start with more challenging concepts and work down to the basics, catering to learners from diverse backgrounds.

## Objects

- **Definition**: Objects in code model the digital world using information, data, and logic.
- **Classes**: Define how objects are created, including their state and functionality.
- **Key Point**: Objects have a common way to define their state and manage it through functionality.
- **Examples**:
  - Creating a \`Robot\` class in JavaScript.
  - Using objects to structure data in applications like social media posts or crypto transactions.
- **Takeaway**: Coding is about organizing information, not about math.

## Functions

- **Purpose**: Essential for organizing and handling data.
- **Types**:
  - **Synchronous Functions**: Execute tasks sequentially (like cooking in a pan).
  - **Asynchronous Functions**: Allow other processes to run concurrently (like cooking in an oven).
- **Importance**: Understanding functions helps manage data flow, especially when handling data across networks.

## Loops

- **Usage**: Perform repeatable actions on groups of data.
- **Types of Looping Functions**:
  - Transforming values.
  - Filtering values.
  - Reversing values.
- **Example**: Using \`forEach\` in JavaScript to find an artist with the highest Spotify monthly listeners.
- **Documentation**: Encouraged to read language documentation to understand built-in methods and functionalities.

## Data and Logic

- **Fundamentals**:
  - Data types include words, numbers, groups, and logical conclusions.
  - Logic boils down to true or false values—how computers interpret the world.
- **Examples**:
  - Defining objects like \`obama\` and \`elon\` with properties.
  - Creating functions that use logical conditions to return results.
- **Key Point**: Individual pieces of data create logic; groups of data create functionality.

## Coding and Logic (Reinforced)

- **Coding**: The organization of information.
- **Logic**: Determining if statements are true or false.
- **Real-World Connection**: Observing how everyday items and situations can be represented in code.
- **Encouragement**: Understand that coding concepts can be grasped without heavy emphasis on math.

## Practice and Learning Strategies

- **Use AI Assistance**: Utilize AI tools like ChatGPT for guidance.
- **Hands-On Practice**:
  - Write code by hand on paper.
  - Draw connections and visualize data structures.
- **Model Real-World Data**: Practice representing real-world scenarios as data models in code.
- **Mindset**: Focus on learning and understanding rather than worrying about right or wrong.

## Conclusion

- **Main Takeaways**:
  - Coding models the digital world with information, data, and logic.
  - Organizing information is the essence of coding.
  - Logic in coding is about true or false values.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Prepare to build visual applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
- **Encouragement**:
  - Slow down and internalize the lessons.
  - Embrace challenges and trust the learning process.
  - Practice consistently to strengthen your skills.

---

**Note**: The lecture emphasizes starting with foundational concepts and building upon them to create a solid understanding of coding. It encourages using available resources, practicing regularly, and maintaining a positive mindset towards learning.

**UI/UX** stands for User Interfaces and User Experiences. It's a multidisciplinary approach based on the study of human-computer interaction, also known as **Interaction Design** or simply **Design**. This field goes beyond visual design and idea brainstorming; it's a thoughtful practice applicable in many environments.

## Role of an Interaction Designer

Interaction designers:

- Research and design based on human-computer interaction.
- Conduct surveys, interviews, and observations to gather deeper insights into a product.
- Focus on improving experiences, such as enhancing a restaurant's experience or determining which movie trailer generates the most anticipation.
- Combine technical skills and business acumen to amplify impact.

## Accessibility

- **Importance**: Accessibility focuses on enabling more people to use products and services.
- **Considerations**:
  - Designing for blind users who rely on screen readers.
  - Organizing information to make sense for both visual and auditory users.
- **Benefits**:
  - Thoughtful accessibility design often benefits all users.
  - Effective organization can make content more meaningful for people using only audio, such as in podcasts or radio.

- **Focus of Lesson 2**: Understanding React components and event-driven programming to create user interfaces and experiences.

## React Components

- **Components**: Functions that return UI elements and manage their own state and properties.
- **Main Parts of a React Component**:
  1. **Hooks**: Functions that handle and synchronize operations with the component's state (e.g., \`useState\`).
  2. **State**: Dynamic data within the component that changes over time, triggering re-renders.
  3. **Properties (Props)**: Data passed into the component that should remain unchanged within it.

- **Event-Based Programming**: React components respond to user interactions (events) that trigger state changes and UI updates.

## Data Flow in React

- React uses a **one-way data flow**, making it intuitive to design relationships and manage data.
- **Updating State**: Changing a component's state refreshes the display and re-renders the component.
- **Props vs. State**:
  - **Props**: Immutable data received from parent components.
  - **State**: Mutable data managed within the component.

## Practical Example: Tweet Component

- Demonstrated a \`Tweet\` component that displays tweet information and handles user interactions like likes.
- Showed how to:
  - Use hooks (\`useState\`) to manage state.
  - Pass functions and data as props to child components.
  - Update state in response to events (e.g., \`createLike\` function).

## Overcoming Challenges

- Recognized that combining hooks, state, and props can be complex.
- Encouraged practice, experimentation, and embracing challenges to understand React's data flow.

- **Elements and Attributes**:
  - **Events**: Handle user interactions like clicks and hovers.
  - **ID**: Unique identifier for elements.
  - **Class**: Groups elements for styling.
  - **Style**: Inline styling of elements.

- Recommended thinking of HTML elements as containers organized logically.

## CSS and Styling Elements

- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Styles the appearance of HTML elements.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Box Model**: Shapes elements using properties like \`margin\`, \`padding\`, \`border\`, and \`width\`.
  - **Flexbox Model**: Positions elements in rows or columns for responsive design.
  - **Animation Model**: Animates elements using CSS animations or JavaScript.

- Suggested using inline styles or CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled-Components with React for better control.

## Combining Concepts

Data Structures and Algorithms is a subject that often intimidates students due to its complexity and its use in challenging interviews. While it is indeed challenging and requires practice, with proper guidance, the concepts can become more approachable.

## Programming Languages

- **Understanding Code Interpretation**:
- Computers interpret code by breaking it down into tokens and translating it into machine code.
- Example:
  \`\`\`javascript
  let musician = new Musician("Drake");
  
  let top_song = musician.getTopSong();
  \`\`\`
- Tokens in the code include keywords (let, new), identifiers (musician, top_song, Musician), operators (=), and literals ("Drake").

- **String Conversion**:
- Strings are broken down into arrays of characters.
  - "Drake" becomes \`['D', 'r', 'a', 'k', 'e']\`.
- Each character is mapped to numerical codes (e.g., ASCII or Unicode) and then to binary representations.

## Data Structures

- **Memory Management**:
- Computers reserve space in memory and create addresses to reference information.
- Understanding how data is stored and referenced is crucial for grasping complex data structures.

- **Linked Lists**:
- A foundational data structure that helps in understanding more complex structures like trees and graphs.
- Represents a sequence of nodes where each node points to the next.

## Trees and Algorithms

- **Traversing Trees**:
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
  - Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
  - Useful for scenarios where you need to explore all possible paths.

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
  - Explores all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level.
  - Ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

- **Example of DFS Counting Null Nodes**:
\`\`\`javascript
let countNull = (root) => {
  let count = 0;

  let depthFirstSearch = (currentRoot) => {
    if (currentRoot === null) {
      count++;
      return;
    }

    for (let nextLocation in currentRoot) {
      depthFirstSearch(currentRoot[nextLocation]);
    }
  };

  depthFirstSearch(root);
  return count;
};
\`\`\`

- **Understanding Traversal**:
- Visualizing how algorithms navigate through data structures helps in comprehending their functionality.
- Breaking down each step and counting operations can clarify complex processes.

## Linked Lists

- **Definition**:
- A linear data structure where each element (node) contains data and a reference (link) to the next node.

- **Building a Linked List**:
\`\`\`javascript
class ListItem {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.linkedTo = null;
  }

  setLinkedTo(listItem) {
    this.linkedTo = listItem;
  }

  getLinkedTo() {
    return this.linkedTo;
  }
}

let meta = new ListItem("meta");
let instagram = new ListItem("instagram");
let reels = new ListItem("reels");

// Linking nodes
instagram.setLinkedTo(reels);
meta.setLinkedTo(instagram);

class LinkedList {
  constructor(head) {
    this.head = head;
  }

  getLastItem() {
    let currentItem = this.head;
    while (currentItem.getLinkedTo()) {
      currentItem = currentItem.getLinkedTo();
    }
    return currentItem;
  }
}

let company = new LinkedList(meta);

// Outputs the last item in the list
console.log(company.getLastItem()); 
\`\`\`

- **Reversing a Linked List**:
\`\`\`javascript
reverse(head) {
  let previousItem = null;
  let currentItem = head;

  while (currentItem) {
    let nextItem = currentItem.getLinkedTo();
    currentItem.setLinkedTo(previousItem);
    previousItem = currentItem;
    currentItem = nextItem;
  }
  return previousItem;
}
\`\`\`

## Practice and Perseverance

      <div>
        Think about how communities fund schools. People work, create income and
        have that incomed taxed in a number of ways to provide the budgets and
        funds for schools. This eventually creates walled gardens and
        inequities.
        <br />
        <br />
        Robots Building Education is a platform using protocols that introduces
        new ways to provide funds for education by connecting participants
        beyond neighborhood lines. When students learn, real economic value is
        created. We believe this should be represented by creating material and
        resilient outcomes for communities so when you answer questions, Bitcoin
        gets automatically sent to recipients you select in the form of
        scholarships.
        <br />
        <br />
        You might notice that this app is a little different than others. Things
        seem to work faster with less rules. Robots Building Education uses open
        source protocols to allow for seamless decentralized, cross-platform and
        permissionless experiences.
        <br />
        <br />
        This means depositing Bitcoin and sending it is as easy as easy as
        scanning a QR code with a popular app like Cash App and answering a
        question. That's it! No more and no less is needed.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is a new way that the internet can work. It can be used and afford
        new experiences like the ability to publish progress across different
        apps, create scholarships with learning or even take your Bitcoin
        deposits to other places!
      </div>
      // <div>
      //   The point of AI is to save you time and energy. At the same time, real
      //   education is about challenging yourself so that you can create real
      //   knowledge. In short, you'll work through 100+ questions and it will
      //   introduce you to building your ideas with software, learning computer
      //   science and creating opportunities for yourself with good technology.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   I also want to teach you quickly, effectively and in a similar fashion
      //   to you having to pick up the skills on the job. At the end of the day, a
      //   software entrepeneur needs to learn about business, engineering,
      //   investing, marketing, sales, design and a number of other well-rounded
      //   skills in order to be successful, which is what we try to prepare you
      //   here with.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   There are many things beyond coding taught on RO.B.E, ranging from the
      //   psychology of self-esteem, to the development of startups distributed
      //   globally. You are encouraged to imagine, think big and work hard in
      //   order to find success here.
      //   <br />
      //   <br /> The app is a service created by Robots Building Education, a
      //   platform founded on researching technology the following three
      //   priorities:
      //   <br /> <br />
      //   1. Every student should have access to many good teachers.
      //   <br />
      //   2. Online education should be the best education.
      //   <br />
      //   3. Learning creates scholarships.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   This is accomplished with the human-computer interaction discipline,
      //   which researches how to make technology more useful and meaningful. I
      //   personally revise anything done with AI to add human touch to it as to
      //   not offer cheap generated material but a genuine delivery of good
      //   quality education.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   The following are all the features and benefits you'll find across the
      //   platform which are typically free. As of now I just ask folks to
      //   optionally sign up for $10 to access more content around
      //   entrepreneurship, finance, and engineering to the work and to create a
      //   stronger network.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   Why so low for so much? I love education technology and I want to work
      //   on this platform until you feel it's worth supporting. I also believe
      //   that social media helps me reach so many people that keeping it low
      //   price is only fair. I would eventually like to explore teaching folks so
      //   we can create a pipeline to access more capital from folks eager to
      //   invest in diverse technology businesses.

        This platform will help you learn fast and effectively, but it is also

        for you to learn and grow using the power of AI. In short, doing things
        the gritty way is often more enjoyable and meaningful. If you come
        across something confusing or tough, work through it! You'll be grateful

      "If AI can program themselves, it's likely that all work as we know it will fundamentally change. But for now, it's going to change the supply and demand of things in a relevant way.",
    faq_1_item_2:
      "In my view, AI makes software engineering more realistic for more people. Before AI, it was clear that there was an unmanageable amount of work being generated in a way where a software engineer would create more work than they could complete. So I personally find it more enjoyable to write code with AI than without it and I believe that it makes more things like entrepreneurship more accessible. Things can actually get done now.",
    faq_1_item_3:
      "Thinking critically, AI is mostly concerned with making good decisions. So roles that depend more on decisions will be impacted. In my view, that's more executive roles, thus the sweetspot these days is being a junior or senior engineer so you could start to build lean businesses on your own. So that's what we try to do here - we arm you with new skills and hope that it influences your decisions or opportunities in a good way.",
    faq_2_question: "What kind of computer do I need?",
    faq_2_item_1:
      "When it comes to learning, I recommend paper and pencil. RO.B.E is not a software intensive program. It can be used on your mobile device or any laptop. I like it on mobile phones.",
    faq_2_item_2:
      "If you're wondering what kind of computer you need to code, I recommend a macbook pro. The next best answer is whatever you can afford. People usually overthink this and the truth is you don't need anything fancy. There's no wrong answer.",
    faq_2_item_3:
      "Macbook pros are good general solution. If you need something specialized and you're certain about your investment, then in a similar spirit, invest in the best computing power you can get.",
    faq_3_question: "Is coding hard? Do I need to be good at math?",
    faq_3_item_1: "This is a loaded question.",
    faq_3_item_2:
      "No. You don't have to be good at math. And programming isn't hard, it's challenging. Education IS overcoming the challenge. You should recognize that you can accomplish the things you want to accomplish.",
    faq_3_item_3:
      "Coding is about organizing information. So if you can write instructions, you can write code.",
    faq_3_item_4:
      "So maybe you ask that question because there's a part of you that wishes someone would tell you that it can be made easy. People can make it easier. It's going to be a challenge, but that's part of the fun too.",
    faq_4_question: "What programming language should I pick?",
    faq_4_item_1:
      "So if you've done any research already, you've probably come across Python and Javascript. They're very popular for a reason, but before explaining why, I strongly recommend to think about what kind of machines you want to work on and what kind of problems you want to solve.",
    faq_4_item_2:
      "The reason Javascript and Python are so widespread is because of the internet. They're mostly used to do a lot of the service work of the internet.",
    faq_4_item_3:
      "But what if you need an iOS app, an android one, a video game, or some kind of robot? Ultimately you'll find that when you learn one language, you kinda learn them all. There's a reason for that, but ultimately it's like worrying whether you should learn how to use a hammer or drill when building a home - you're likely going to use many languages eventually and it'll all feel pretty familiar. There's no wrong answer.",
    faq_5_question: "Is a bootcamp worth it?",
    faq_5_item_1:
      "As usual, the best answer is going to be 'it depends'. What you really pay a lot of money for is an employment network, and as you've seen in recent years, that kind of business can experience hard times.",
    faq_5_item_2:
      "I don't recommend going to a bootcamp as a shortcut into the industry. A bootcamp is no different than being self-taught or going to college. You will still need to learn relevant skills, find early-stage employment, create business-savvy projects and pass technical interviews.",
    faq_5_item_3:
      "How you approach each will be wildly different. A self-taught developer in San Francisco is different than a computer science student in Nebraska. A dropout from Stanford will have a different environment than someone at a community college. The key thing here is that your environment plays an important role in your opportunities.",
    faq_6_question: "What is coding and what can I do with it?",
    faq_6_item_1:
      "Coding is a way to organize information. So it exists everywhere. Think of it this way. Coding is written by software engineers to organize information. Software engineers study computer science. Computer science is the science of computation. Computation is problem solving. So coding expresses the science of solving problems.",
    faq_6_item_2:
      "That means you can do just about anything. You can code for media, medicine research, sports, robots, energy systems, financial systems or just about anything you can think of. It's certainly a preferred game for entrepreneurs, but many people also take the well-balanced life approach with it too. So sometimes people code because they want a more relaxed life too.",
    faq_7_question: "Am I too old to learn?",
    faq_7_item_1:
      "No. Simply put, your brain doesn't work that way. You may experience some 'rustyness' if you haven't done deep learning of a subject in some time, but that's not too different than a college student realizing that they need to learn how to learn. Maybe you already know how to learn or you understand what works for you. Now suddenly you have an advantage.",
    faq_7_item_2:
      "As one of my directors say, slow is smooth and smooth is fast. This isn't to create any sense of superiority or inferiority - you're just in a competitive market and it's usually better to take the productive outlook.",

## Overview

This lecture introduces the fundamentals of coding, focusing on:

- **Objects**
- **Functions**
- **Loops**
- **Data and Logic**
- **Network Functions**

The approach is to start with more challenging concepts and work down to the basics, catering to learners from diverse backgrounds.

## Objects

- **Definition**: Objects in code model the digital world using information, data, and logic.
- **Classes**: Define how objects are created, including their state and functionality.
- **Key Point**: Objects have a common way to define their state and manage it through functionality.
- **Examples**:
  - Creating a \`Robot\` class in JavaScript.
  - Using objects to structure data in applications like social media posts or crypto transactions.
- **Takeaway**: Coding is about organizing information, not about math.

## Functions

- **Purpose**: Essential for organizing and handling data.
- **Types**:
  - **Synchronous Functions**: Execute tasks sequentially (like cooking in a pan).
  - **Asynchronous Functions**: Allow other processes to run concurrently (like cooking in an oven).
- **Importance**: Understanding functions helps manage data flow, especially when handling data across networks.

## Loops

- **Usage**: Perform repeatable actions on groups of data.
- **Types of Looping Functions**:
  - Transforming values.
  - Filtering values.
  - Reversing values.
- **Example**: Using \`forEach\` in JavaScript to find an artist with the highest Spotify monthly listeners.
- **Documentation**: Encouraged to read language documentation to understand built-in methods and functionalities.

## Data and Logic

- **Fundamentals**:
  - Data types include words, numbers, groups, and logical conclusions.
  - Logic boils down to true or false values—how computers interpret the world.
- **Examples**:
  - Defining objects like \`obama\` and \`elon\` with properties.
  - Creating functions that use logical conditions to return results.
- **Key Point**: Individual pieces of data create logic; groups of data create functionality.

## Coding and Logic (Reinforced)

- **Coding**: The organization of information.
- **Logic**: Determining if statements are true or false.
- **Real-World Connection**: Observing how everyday items and situations can be represented in code.
- **Encouragement**: Understand that coding concepts can be grasped without heavy emphasis on math.

## Practice and Learning Strategies

- **Use AI Assistance**: Utilize AI tools like ChatGPT for guidance.
- **Hands-On Practice**:
  - Write code by hand on paper.
  - Draw connections and visualize data structures.
- **Model Real-World Data**: Practice representing real-world scenarios as data models in code.
- **Mindset**: Focus on learning and understanding rather than worrying about right or wrong.

## Conclusion

- **Main Takeaways**:
  - Coding models the digital world with information, data, and logic.
  - Organizing information is the essence of coding.
  - Logic in coding is about true or false values.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Prepare to build visual applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
- **Encouragement**:
  - Slow down and internalize the lessons.
  - Embrace challenges and trust the learning process.
  - Practice consistently to strengthen your skills.

    "video.summary.1": `
**UI/UX** stands for User Interfaces and User Experiences. It's a multidisciplinary approach based on the study of human-computer interaction, also known as **Interaction Design** or simply **Design**. This field goes beyond visual design and idea brainstorming; it's a thoughtful practice applicable in many environments.

## Role of an Interaction Designer

Interaction designers:

- Research and design based on human-computer interaction.
- Conduct surveys, interviews, and observations to gather deeper insights into a product.
- Focus on improving experiences, such as enhancing a restaurant's experience or determining which movie trailer generates the most anticipation.
- Combine technical skills and business acumen to amplify impact.

## Accessibility

- **Importance**: Accessibility focuses on enabling more people to use products and services.
- **Considerations**:
  - Designing for blind users who rely on screen readers.
  - Organizing information to make sense for both visual and auditory users.
- **Benefits**:
  - Thoughtful accessibility design often benefits all users.
  - Effective organization can make content more meaningful for people using only audio, such as in podcasts or radio.

## Multidisciplinarity

- Design is fundamentally multidisciplinary and can be applied in fields like chemical engineering, business, architecture, and education.
- **Impact of Choices**:
  - The words you choose can influence how search engines and social media algorithms distribute your material.
  - The intent behind features and the tone you use can affect user retention and success.
- **Attention to Detail**: Good design is about making the people you're designing for happy, which requires direct communication and research.

## Heuristics

- **Definition**: Heuristics are guidelines used when creating with constraints or limited feedback.
- **Application**:
  - Considering how a user can correct a mistake or malfunction.
  - Using concepts like **affordances**, which are signals or properties of an object that inform a user of its possible uses.
- **Examples**:
  - Recognizing that a water pitcher is meant for pouring water, not as a glove.
  - Understanding that pixels on a screen represent interactive buttons.

## Design Systems

- **Review of Lesson 1**: Fundamentals of organizing data with code using objects, functions, loops, and logic.
- **Focus of Lesson 2**: Understanding React components and event-driven programming to create user interfaces and experiences.

## React Components

- **Components**: Functions that return UI elements and manage their own state and properties.
- **Main Parts of a React Component**:
  1. **Hooks**: Functions that handle and synchronize operations with the component's state (e.g., \`useState\`).
  2. **State**: Dynamic data within the component that changes over time, triggering re-renders.
  3. **Properties (Props)**: Data passed into the component that should remain unchanged within it.

- **Event-Based Programming**: React components respond to user interactions (events) that trigger state changes and UI updates.

## Data Flow in React

- React uses a **one-way data flow**, making it intuitive to design relationships and manage data.
- **Updating State**: Changing a component's state refreshes the display and re-renders the component.
- **Props vs. State**:
  - **Props**: Immutable data received from parent components.
  - **State**: Mutable data managed within the component.

## Practical Example: Tweet Component

- Demonstrated a \`Tweet\` component that displays tweet information and handles user interactions like likes.
- Showed how to:
  - Use hooks (\`useState\`) to manage state.
  - Pass functions and data as props to child components.
  - Update state in response to events (e.g., \`createLike\` function).

## Overcoming Challenges

- Recognized that combining hooks, state, and props can be complex.
- Encouraged practice, experimentation, and embracing challenges to understand React's data flow.
- Emphasized that professional software engineers also navigate these complexities.

## HTML and Structuring the Display

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: Used to structure content on the web.
- **Elements and Attributes**:
  - **Events**: Handle user interactions like clicks and hovers.
  - **ID**: Unique identifier for elements.
  - **Class**: Groups elements for styling.
  - **Style**: Inline styling of elements.

- Recommended thinking of HTML elements as containers organized logically.

## CSS and Styling Elements

- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Styles the appearance of HTML elements.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Box Model**: Shapes elements using properties like \`margin\`, \`padding\`, \`border\`, and \`width\`.
  - **Flexbox Model**: Positions elements in rows or columns for responsive design.
  - **Animation Model**: Animates elements using CSS animations or JavaScript.

- Suggested using inline styles or CSS-in-JS libraries like Styled-Components with React for better control.

## Combining Concepts

- Provided examples of combining React components with HTML and CSS to create interactive UI elements.
- Showed how to use state and event handlers to manage data and user interactions.
- Emphasized the importance of understanding how these technologies work together.

## Practice and Learning

- Encouraged using resources like W3Schools and documentation to explore HTML and CSS attributes.
- Recommended leveraging AI tools like ChatGPT for assistance.
- Highlighted the value of hands-on experimentation and breaking down complex problems.

## Conclusion

- Reinforced that mastering frontend development involves understanding components, data flow, and styling.

Data Structures and Algorithms is a subject that often intimidates students due to its complexity and its use in challenging interviews. While it is indeed challenging and requires practice, with proper guidance, the concepts can become more approachable.

## Programming Languages

- **Understanding Code Interpretation**:
- Computers interpret code by breaking it down into tokens and translating it into machine code.
- Example:
  \`\`\`javascript
  let musician = new Musician("Drake");
  
  let top_song = musician.getTopSong();
  \`\`\`
- Tokens in the code include keywords (let, new), identifiers (musician, top_song, Musician), operators (=), and literals ("Drake").

- **String Conversion**:
- Strings are broken down into arrays of characters.
  - "Drake" becomes \`['D', 'r', 'a', 'k', 'e']\`.
- Each character is mapped to numerical codes (e.g., ASCII or Unicode) and then to binary representations.

## Data Structures

- **Memory Management**:
- Computers reserve space in memory and create addresses to reference information.
- Understanding how data is stored and referenced is crucial for grasping complex data structures.

- **Linked Lists**:
- A foundational data structure that helps in understanding more complex structures like trees and graphs.
- Represents a sequence of nodes where each node points to the next.

## Trees and Algorithms

- **Traversing Trees**:
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
  - Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
  - Useful for scenarios where you need to explore all possible paths.

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
  - Explores all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level.
  - Ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

- **Example of DFS Counting Null Nodes**:
\`\`\`javascript
let countNull = (root) => {
  let count = 0;

  let depthFirstSearch = (currentRoot) => {
    if (currentRoot === null) {
      count++;
      return;
    }

    for (let nextLocation in currentRoot) {
      depthFirstSearch(currentRoot[nextLocation]);
    }
  };

  depthFirstSearch(root);
  return count;
};
\`\`\`

- **Understanding Traversal**:
- Visualizing how algorithms navigate through data structures helps in comprehending their functionality.
- Breaking down each step and counting operations can clarify complex processes.

## Linked Lists

- **Definition**:
- A linear data structure where each element (node) contains data and a reference (link) to the next node.

- **Building a Linked List**:
\`\`\`javascript
class ListItem {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.linkedTo = null;
  }

  setLinkedTo(listItem) {
    this.linkedTo = listItem;
  }

  getLinkedTo() {
    return this.linkedTo;
  }
}

let meta = new ListItem("meta");
let instagram = new ListItem("instagram");
let reels = new ListItem("reels");

// Linking nodes
instagram.setLinkedTo(reels);
meta.setLinkedTo(instagram);

class LinkedList {
  constructor(head) {
    this.head = head;
  }

  getLastItem() {
    let currentItem = this.head;
    while (currentItem.getLinkedTo()) {
      currentItem = currentItem.getLinkedTo();
    }
    return currentItem;
  }
}

let company = new LinkedList(meta);

// Outputs the last item in the list
console.log(company.getLastItem()); 
\`\`\`

- **Reversing a Linked List**:
\`\`\`javascript
reverse(head) {
  let previousItem = null;
  let currentItem = head;

  while (currentItem) {
    let nextItem = currentItem.getLinkedTo();
    currentItem.setLinkedTo(previousItem);
    previousItem = currentItem;
    currentItem = nextItem;
  }
  return previousItem;
}
\`\`\`

## Practice and Perseverance

- **Importance of Repetition**:
- Repeatedly practicing these concepts helps in making them second nature.
- Taking time to thoroughly understand foundational structures is crucial for tackling advanced topics.

- **Approach to Learning**:
- Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.

      <div>
        Think about how communities fund schools. People work, create income and
        have that incomed taxed in a number of ways to provide the budgets and
        funds for schools. This eventually creates walled gardens and
        inequities.
        <br />
        <br />
        Robots Building Education is a platform using protocols that introduces
        new ways to provide funds for education by connecting participants
        beyond neighborhood lines. When students learn, real economic value is
        created. We believe this should be represented by creating material and
        resilient outcomes for communities so when you answer questions, Bitcoin
        gets automatically sent to recipients you select in the form of
        scholarships.
        <br />
        <br />
        You might notice that this app is a little different than others. Things
        seem to work faster with less rules. Robots Building Education uses open
        source protocols to allow for seamless decentralized, cross-platform and
        permissionless experiences.
        <br />
        <br />
        This means depositing Bitcoin and sending it is as easy as easy as
        scanning a QR code with a popular app like Cash App and answering a
        question. That's it! No more and no less is needed.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is a new way that the internet can work. It can be used and afford
        new experiences like the ability to publish progress across different
        apps, create scholarships with learning or even take your Bitcoin
        deposits to other places!
      </div>
      // <div>
      //   The point of AI is to save you time and energy. At the same time, real
      //   education is about challenging yourself so that you can create real
      //   knowledge. In short, you'll work through 100+ questions and it will
      //   introduce you to building your ideas with software, learning computer
      //   science and creating opportunities for yourself with good technology.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   I also want to teach you quickly, effectively and in a similar fashion
      //   to you having to pick up the skills on the job. At the end of the day, a
      //   software entrepeneur needs to learn about business, engineering,
      //   investing, marketing, sales, design and a number of other well-rounded
      //   skills in order to be successful, which is what we try to prepare you
      //   here with.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   There are many things beyond coding taught on RO.B.E, ranging from the
      //   psychology of self-esteem, to the development of startups distributed
      //   globally. You are encouraged to imagine, think big and work hard in
      //   order to find success here.
      //   <br />
      //   <br /> The app is a service created by Robots Building Education, a
      //   platform founded on researching technology the following three
      //   priorities:
      //   <br /> <br />
      //   1. Every student should have access to many good teachers.
      //   <br />
      //   2. Online education should be the best education.
      //   <br />
      //   3. Learning creates scholarships.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   This is accomplished with the human-computer interaction discipline,
      //   which researches how to make technology more useful and meaningful. I
      //   personally revise anything done with AI to add human touch to it as to
      //   not offer cheap generated material but a genuine delivery of good
      //   quality education.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   The following are all the features and benefits you'll find across the
      //   platform which are typically free. As of now I just ask folks to
      //   optionally sign up for $10 to access more content around
      //   entrepreneurship, finance, and engineering to the work and to create a
      //   stronger network.
      //   <br />
      //   <br />
      //   Why so low for so much? I love education technology and I want to work
      //   on this platform until you feel it's worth supporting. I also believe
      //   that social media helps me reach so many people that keeping it low
      //   price is only fair. I would eventually like to explore teaching folks so
      //   we can create a pipeline to access more capital from folks eager to
      //   invest in diverse technology businesses.

        This platform will help you learn fast and effectively, but it is also

        for you to learn and grow using the power of AI. In short, doing things
        the gritty way is often more enjoyable and meaningful. If you come
        across something confusing or tough, work through it! You'll be grateful
